summer,Calgary,w4m,**Caution** Ads directing you to NSAtonight or Flirtbuddies - w4m,"Flirt buddies is a scam website. The people that these girls are talking about do not exist. The website is a fraud designed to make you feel girls are interested in one night stands. Without even having to post a picture or fill out your profile you will have ""Girls"" message you and send you gifts to make you want to purchase a membership in order to respond to them. Thankfully my credit card didn't work and I had time to think about the legitimacy of this website. (a) The girls are attractive enough to easily find guys and they are posting pictures of their bear chest for everyone to see?(b) You can only view a limited amount of profiles before you have to upgrade to full membership(c) they are resorting to craigslist, posting ads of missed connections to try to attract new members.Do what you want, but take my advice and don't waste your money. you'll be glad you did."

summer,Calgary,w4m,who would have thought. - w4m,"Never in a million years would I have thought I would have to sit here and write these things on the Internet, I am not one to post my personal life on any kind of site.  However here Iam an actually real person  just wanting to pour their soul out to someone who will listen. I don't Know what I expect from this. Perhaps it's just easier to see your thoughts written down. Almost ten months ago, I fell head over heals for someone who I thought would change my life. Change my life he did. Have you ever met that someone where nothing else matters. All your mind space is filled with nothing but thoughts of them? I gave up everything. I threw it all away. Not only for him, but because I put up with so much hurt and Pain for many years.He was my way out. My sign as to say wtf are you doing? This is your life so do it. Do you. Do me! I Eneded up falling for him the very first time I set my eyes upon him. He consumed me. All I wanted was him. And I still do, but he won't let me in. If anything all I ask from someone is pure honesty. No matter what it is. Sometimes finding honesty is as hard as finding a needle in a haystack per say. I do believe he came into my life for a reason, and that was to help me push away from the vicious life I was leading.  I'm here, I have my bad days in which I wish to give up.  It's just me. All me. However I am pushing through day by day and finding the person I was, no the amazing person I was. I guess my point is. Yes I fell for this man. He told me everything I needed to hear. Sweet, loving not to mention so very handsome. He can never be mine. Not how I wish.  He has made it so hard for me to care about him. I have finally given up.  So to all the people who may be feeling defeated tonight and read this. Just know your not alone. Let's carry our heads high and do what needs to be done. Noone can defeat us but ourselves. So stay strong. Do not let anyone bring you down. And to you my secret love. Maybe one day you'll see what passed you by. Xx"

I sent out my most trusted and loyal courier pigeons--Larry, Moe, and Curly--it seems as though their flight must have been interrupted by their frequent cocaine and gambling habits. Never trust a bird.Now that we've found each other in the bottomless depth of the internet, I suggest you start the courting process. I shall not dedicate an afternoon (or a morning, for that matter) of love without some sort of musical montage or dance sequence. In the very least, you could reenact a scene from Ghostbusters.In return I will woo you with my ability to cut a sandwich both diagonally and horizontally, and throw popcorn at the television when your favorite sports team loses. Close your eyes. Count to three. Imagine the scent of pickles wafting through the air, hearing the unnecessary screech of tires (my angelic voice). Now picture yourself--basking in the scent of the old shoe you've been carrying around. This is heaven."

I checked the telegraph every day hoping for news from you , but the telegraph wires have been strangely silent these past few years.

I have your shoe my love , it smells just as terrible as the day you left it there for me to find . I wear it each night to bed , thinking of you , dreaming of you , dreams of love and lust and longing . And I knew this day would come, so I saved you a bite. The kebab not the shoe.

summer,Calgary,w4m,RE: most beautiful girl in the world - w4m,"I remember that rainy day quite fondly, the smell of hot sauce still stings. The scent of regret.I saw you, dripping in hot sauce, grasping your kebab like a bouquet of roses. Your red/black hair was illuminated against the backdrop of the looming pawn shops that surrounded us.  In that crucial moment, I ran to get you several hundred napkins to caress your chiseled/soft face, contoured with fiery red peppers.The Nike trainer was mine. How did you know? It was given to me by my father on his death bed. The last words he ever said to me was ""find your soulmate, my buttercup. He will fit perfectly into this used shoe that I collected from the neighbor's trash can.""That's when I knew you and I were connected on the deepest level possible--the internet.Sometimes I stand on my balcony, screaming your name in longing and agony. Fate has brought us together again. Never kebab up hope."

summer,Calgary,m4w,The most beautiful girl in the world - m4w,"You were walking in the rain your blonde / brunette hair dripping tiny rivulets of water tracing the perfect contours of your pale / tanned cheek. Our eyes met across the busy road and in that moment I was changed forever. I knew as certainly as night follows day that you would be mine one day. And I knew you probably felt the same. But I was eating a kebab and hot sauce was dripping on my shirt , I looked down self consciously and tried to wipe it off and dropped my kebab in a puddle and by the time I had picked it up and dried it off by wiping it on my shirt , I looked up.... And you were gone! I ran for hours , water streaming down my face rain mixed with tears of sorrow, stopping only occasionally to eat my kebab which was really delicious ,and then I found a single shoe at the bottom of the cathedral steps, it was a men's Nike trainer,  probably completely unconnected to you, but I keep it close to me still. By the way this all happened in West London 10 years ago but you looked sort of Canadian so I followed you here to Calgary and roamed the streets night and day searching for you. For years I have searched to no avail, and then today I overheard a man on a bus talking about this new internet thing and I realised that you have probably been waiting here right in the internet , longing for me, crying yourself to sleep at night , longing for the man with the kebab, the man of your dreams. If you are the most beautiful girl in the world from so many years ago, the one with the beautiful breasts, and fancy hooking up for a casual fling, even just a one timer, that would be awesome.

A space reserved for those cravings I refuse to indulge.Despite my persistence, my efforts are in vein. A glimmer of weightlessness washes over me every time I hear your name. I am vaguely aware of the intensity and provocation that I hide from when you are near. I keep my distance, lurking in the shadows of my own heart. But you pry open my rib cage and tear at my heart. Insurmountable, I lay defenseless at your feet. My darkest secret rippled with betrayal and deceit.Months of struggling with this burgeoning burden finally leads me to a place of openness and promise. I am no longer shackled by the chains that hold me back from my deepest desires. Finally, I am yours."

Me...im smooth...clean shaved..handsome (so im told)...funny..laid back..masculine...sensitive..adventurous...honest..genuine..understanding...discrete...loyal.nand ive been told im good at a few fun things in the sack, if we get into the sack that is. Be nice to find  a guy who is into fishing/camping aka not afraid of getting dirty but who can also have a sensual side if we get chilly camping and need to cuddle up.. someone whod be a fun friend to hang out with sometimes and perhaps even some benifits...are you out there?

Insurmountable, I lay defenseless at your feet. My darkest secret rippled with betrayal and deceit.Months of struggling with this burgeoning burden finally leads me to a place of openness and promise. I am no longer shackled by the chains that hold me back from my deepest desires. Finally, I am yours."

You understand me so well, but just stop texting me as if I was nothing. One day I will have forgetten, What it is like to care for someone so much. One day I will wake up and not think of you. One day I will go to bed, and not think of you before I close my eyes and fall asleep. One day I will not dream of you.

summer,Fraser Valley,m4w,sociopath - m4w,"This is so u Glibness and Superficial Charm Manipulative and Conning They never recognize the rights of others and see their self-serving behaviors as permissible. They appear to be charming, yet are covertly hostile and domineering, seeing their victim as merely an instrument to be used. They may dominate and humiliate their victims. Grandiose Sense of Self Feels entitled to certain things as ""their right."" Pathological Lying Has no problem lying coolly and easily and it is almost impossible for them to be truthful on a consistent basis. Can create, and get caught up in, a complex belief about their own powers and abilities. Extremely convincing and even able to pass lie detector tests. Lack of Remorse, Shame or Guilt A deep seated rage, which is split off and repressed, is at their core. Does not see others around them as people, but only as targets and opportunities. Instead of friends, they have victims and accomplices who end up as victims. The end always justifies the means and they let nothing stand in their way. Shallow Emotions When they show what seems to be warmth, joy, love and compassion it is more feigned than experienced and serves an ulterior motive. Outraged by insignificant matters, yet remaining unmoved and cold by what would upset a normal person. Since they are not genuine, neither are their promises. Incapacity for Love Need for Stimulation Living on the edge. Verbal outbursts and physical punishments are normal. Promiscuity and gambling are common.Callousness/Lack of Empathy Unable to empathize with the pain of their victims, having only contempt for others' feelings of distress and readily taking advantage of them. Poor Behavioral Controls/Impulsive Nature Rage and abuse, alternating with small expressions of love and approval produce an addictive cycle for abuser and abused, as well as creating hopelessness in the victim. Believe they are all-powerful, all-knowing, entitled to every wish, no sense of personal boundaries, no concern for their impact on others. Early Behavior Problems/Juvenile Delinquency Usually has a history of behavioral and academic difficulties, yet ""gets by"" by conning others. Problems in making and keeping friends; aberrant behaviors such as cruelty to people or animals, stealing, etc. Irresponsibility/Unreliability Not concerned about wrecking others' lives and dreams. Oblivious or indifferent to the devastation they cause. Does not accept blame themselves, but blames others, even for acts they obviously committed. Promiscuous Sexual Behavior/Infidelity Promiscuity, child sexual abuse, rape and sexual acting out of all sorts. Lack of Realistic Life Plan/Parasitic Lifestyle Tends to move around a lot or makes all encompassing promises for the future, poor work ethic but exploits others effectively. Criminal or Entrepreneurial Versatility Changes their image as needed to avoid prosecution. Changes life story readily.Other Related Qualities:Contemptuous of those who seek to understand themDoes not perceive that anything is wrong with themAuthoritarianSecretiveParanoidOnly rarely in difficulty with the law, but seeks out situations where their tyrannical behavior will be tolerated, condoned, or admiredConventional appearanceGoal of enslavement of their victim(s)Exercises despotic control over every aspect of the victim's lifeHas an emotional need to justify their crimes and therefore needs their victim's affirmation (respect, gratitude and love)Ultimate goal is the creation of a willing victimIncapable of real human attachment to anotherUnable to feel remorse or guiltExtreme narcissism and grandioseMay state readily that their goal is to rule the world"

summer,Kelowna / Okanagan,m4w,You are my fantasy girl.. The one I will always want - m4w,"From our first encounters all those years ago, when we innocently held each other and kissed the way silly teenagers kiss, I loved you. Yours was my first kiss, and it was my best kiss, one I will always remember. We drifted apart over the years, each finding others to love, but always found our way back to each other, our love deepening. Our timing was always wrong, and we never have gotten to be truly together. You are the reason I am inextricably drawn to smiling blondes, fun girls and perfect round bottoms and voluptuous breasts. I dream about you, I think about you - and even when I am with others you come back into my mind time and time again. I fantasize about us walking on a tropical beach, side by side and holding hands while the sun sets. Even though we may never get our chance, I am better for having had the chance to know you as a friend, lover and fucktoy. Perhaps one day our timings will align, and we will get to effortlessly embark on the path we were meant to follow - together.  You think you know who this is, you are probably right :)Love always.xo"

At the time you still wanted to be friends with me saying that I couldn't do it and I stand by my reasons, but now that more time has passed I wonder if we could make a friendship work. You messaged me out of the blue recently and our conversation that came out of it reminded me just how much fun our chats always were and that it would be nice to have those again.  I know better than to read anything into you messaging me unprompted like that, but it doesn't mean I don't want to believe it was because you want to start to talk.I doubt I'll hear from you again any time soon, but I would like to.  I just hope my we can move past things and not be afraid to talk to one another for fear of giving the wrong impression of what we are looking for to the other person."

I'd hold your hand whenever you want, and protect you from anything you asked me to - as a strong woman, you don't need me to take care of you, but you know I like it when you let me. I'd do things to make you laugh. I'd fix things for you and build things for you. I'd dance with you at least once a week, and make love with you as often as you wished. I'd allow myself to cry in front of you, and I'd do my best to never say harsh things in anger. I'd surprise you with flowers, or words, or something else, when you least expect it. I'd tell you every day what a wonderful mother you are, and that this is one of many reasons I'm so proud to be your partner. I'd always treat you with respect, and if I didn't, I'd expect you to call me on it and leave me if I don't improve. I'd do anything to make you smile, I'd do anything to make you feel good, and I'd do anything to have the chance to grow old with you. In my heart, I'm already your guy, lover. Every night when I fall asleep I imagine you're laying warm next to me, and I'm so content.Love you too :) Sweet dreams."

You were never honest with me and you were not honest with anyone else. The proof came to a head the night at the gas station actually both those nights. You need to stand up and take responsibility for it. You think because you found an idiot who was fooled by your lies that you got away with it? He was the only one who was fooled. Your own family knows the truth they always have. I just didn't know that for a long time. He was fooled the most that is why he was cheated on the most.I went a long time without actually doing anything that really hurt you even though you had no problem hurting me over and over and that was from your lies.

summer,Victoria,w4m,Re: Chasing - w4m,"Uh, wait--you hounded her even though she kept trying to turn you down nicely by saying it was *her* and that she wasn't worth it, and now you're mad at her?  Sounds like she was trying to get rid of you nicely until you pushed her to say something mean to you.  Why do guys DO THAT??Guys don't seem to get when a girl isn't interested until she is brutal.  She'll say it nicely, and she'll say it repeatedly to spare your feelings, and you won't leave her alone until she is at the end of her rope and you force her to snap and say something horrible just to get through to you.She didn't WANT any part of a relationship with you clearly, c'mon, guy, you need to move on."
summer,Victoria,m4w,Ending worse - m4w,"It is not with any pleasure that this must end even worse than it already has.Unfortunately it does.

You have figured that out though."
summer,Victoria,m4w,Chasing - m4w,"I chased you over and over in spite of every effort you made to convince me you were not worth chasing because my heart refused to believe you were not.You didn't convince me you convinced yourself. You did everything you could to make people right and to have no healthy active part in a relationship. Here is a piece of info for you!! The other person is allowed to have their own issues and bad days when they need help and support. When you do things that hurt them stop doing those things!!Simple!!!"

I went around the block to catch your eye again, but you didn't seem to notice as you were glued to your phone.

You are unljke any other woman I know or have met. And clearly, im not only going after you for sex since we are not even living in the same province/area of Canada. You have such an awesome and magnetic personality that continues to draw me in and wanting to know you for the woman you are. I hate myself for coming onto mfc, truthbe told it makes me feel like a sleezeball. But had i not come across you there, i may have never even known someone like you is out there. I often wonder why i couldnt meet someone like you randomly shopping, or in line waiting for a coffee. But such is life. I want you to know that i wish you happiness. I wish you find the love you seek and that you live your days always smiling. I wish you good health and to always be in good spirits. Do not let anyone ever make you feel less. You are a good soul. You are special.M"

When I think back I could have been a better man and treated you better and I really don't know what made us fall apart besides the obvious, but on a good note it has caused change in me and gave me time to reflect on what is really important to me.

I haven't come straight out and told you all of this and maybe it's my stubborn pride, but I have dropped hints by giving you random small gifts and inviting you out without making it seem like a date.I hope when we deal with some things this week you will take me up on my offer for dinner and a night out.I still love and miss you.

summer,Victoria,m4w,I'm not like anyone else...and I hope you can understand - m4w,"Where to begin?  Should I start with the awkward repressesive upbringing I had...?  The uncommunicative parents who left me unable to express the feelings I have and instead bind them up inside until it's too late and turn into regret and depression...How about the total lack of confidence from being rejected over and over again...and the physical issue doesn't help at all either...Would you be able to understand that I've spent too much of my life alone and slowly becoming less and less comfortable around anyone...And there is far more...but it would be better if we talked in person...this isn't going to be easy at all for me...or for you...but maybe we can make things work out between us if we can find a way to communicate to each other and find a common ground on which to build from..."

summer,Victoria,m4w,Not in a timely manner. - m4w,"You have no idea how obsessed I am with you lately, it kind of blows my mind. I have the biggest crush on you since... well, since I can remember, like ever. I miss our once per weekly time together, and then when you got in touch after checking out for a month? well, I think I barely slept that night. And to see you again after a month, to spend two hours leaning against a wall chatting, well that was the best day in a long, long time. Every time I email you I check my inbox obsessively to see if you've replied. I often fantasize about just holding hands with you, never mind a sensual kiss. I'm constantly hatching plans about how I can get some time alone with you. I guess a relationship of the romantic kind is pretty much out of the question, and even a platonic relationship seems impossible to actually swing, but you have really shaken my foundation. It kills me that you've had such a hard time with guys, from the shithead ex-husband I never want to slam in your company because I don't want to indirectly insult you, but come on, what an ass! to your most recent, the un-boyfriend. What an idiot, dude has no idea, no idea what he's giving up for fear of even just the tiniest bit of commital. If only I could even tell you how amazing you are, and how attracted to you I am. I guess for now I'll just keep obsessively checking my emails, hoping to hear from you, and looking forward to seeing you again. I'd spend all day, every day leaning against a brick wall talking to you, if I could."

If said person doesn't reply I will probably crawl back rather sheepishly but I won't like it and will be wearing a disguise to insure to not be trampled and eaten not necessarily in that order. If you're making jewelry which you really don't like anyway and you see this, reply. That's it , time to find the reasoning behind the obscene phone call voice the hound has adopted."

summer,Victoria,m4w,Witty's Lagoon in Yellow - m4w,"Drenched and entrenched in my own sorrow I decided, on the Victoria Day long weekend, to humiliate myself further by going for a picnic moi-meme.  Witty's lagoon seemed the perfect locale to enjoy my pre-packaged snacks and ever-present solitude.  With a French baguette and a heart full of regret in tow, I decided to trot my way down to the waterfront.  Thumbing haphazardly through some tattered edition of metaphysical poetry at a splintered picnic bench, my eyes (by chance, oh dread, exquisite chance!) happened to wander and I noticed you.There you were, all raven-haired and long-limbed in a yellow sundress, fluttering about the sand with a winsome smile on your face. You appeared like a touch of sunlight in the midst of my shrouded loneliness -- how very apropos. I immediately dropped my book to the ground whilst my heart soared up into the heavens.  A thought, a moment, a glance: dare I speak to her? But no, I was choked by my own insecurities and my one reward is a wistful heart.  Please get back to me if you noticed me, I did see you look over at me. Tell me the colour of the sun visor I was donning so I know it was you; it was around 3 p.m. Oh, how I should love to kiss that tiny galaxy of freckles dusted across your nose and buy you something quaint!"

summer,Victoria,m4w,"TK, I've been waiting forever - m4w","What in the world ever happened to you? Where did you go? You've been the great unanswered mystery to my life, and I thought I'd at least catch some word of your existence by now, but instead I've been a leaf dangling from a strand of web twisting in the wind. It was like magic being around you, and I know it was the same for you. Maybe it's still there, maybe it's not, I don't know, but without ever knowing I will remain continually lost, it seems, as thinking of you has become as rote as breathing after all these years. My brain has just never figured out how to bypass my heart.I thought I'd fallen in love before, but what we had between us was/is once-in-a-lifetime-if-you're-lucky type stuff. Or so it seemed to me at least.As much as anything though, I just miss my friend...JK <- not just kidding"

I was in the produce isle and, you passed by once more giving an easing smile. You proceeded to the checkout. I followed to another... Of course mine was held up. When I went out side I couldn't find you, while I was driving out I saw you again I circled around and missed you again : (.I haven't seen you in my area before, you were wearing a black and, white dress with heals.

summer,Victoria,m4w,Cayman in Cook street village - m4w,"To the woman I met in the parking lot in cook street village. I commented on how sexy your Cayman was. I did actually see you before seeing your car but didn't have the guts to say you're infinitely more sexy than your car, and considering I think your car is the sexiest machine on the roads, that puts you right up there. This is a long shot but hey you never know."
summer,Victoria,m4w,WatchIt in Mayfair - blondie ;) - m4w,"I come in every now and then and look at the same titanium Citizen (I already have the Skyhawk in titanium). We also chat for about five or ten minutes, talking about the different styles of Citizens and making my threats of either buying another watch or putting the money towards a new truck ;) Truth be told the reason why I haven't bought the watch is because I wouldn't really have much of an excuse to come in and see you. I was in yesterday, arm still all wrapped up in a cast from my surgery and was also on my way to a doctors appointment. Over the last day I've been thinking of our past interactions and from that I really want to get to know you.I know your name and you know mine. Not going to say yours here but I'll leave some hints so you know I'm talking about you; you have long blonde hair, cool flower tattoo on your right forearm and a G Clef tattoo on your left forearm. Really don't know what the chances are of you seeing this but I hope you do and I hope you respond. Maybe that's why I've never asked you out or for your number... maybe I've been a bit chicken shit not knowing if you're single or not."
summer,Victoria,m4w,Laura - m4w,"I just want you to know that I still have feelings for you. I've been single for a very long time and I really fell in love with you. I'm sorry for all the arguments we had. Sorry that we're different. We had culture differences, youre independent and I'm family oriented, we had lots of conflicts. I really wanted to end up with you but it seems like it wont happen unfortunately. I am still in pain and in the healing process but even after moving on, I think there will be a scar in my heart. I need you to do a little favor for me, sweety. I know we cant be together anymore but if ever youll look for a guy again, choose a person with a good heart because looks are deceiving and it passes. I love you, Laura. I guess I need to start diverting my mind to other stuffs to completely forget about all this pain our break up inflicted to me."
summer,Victoria,m4w,im sorry - m4w,"I know you saw him after we fought even though you say the two of you don't talk anymore. I know he's not the only one. I just wish you would stop lying to me and stop pretending that I am the only one you have been with in the last several years so we can move on. I am truly sorry, from the deepest recesses of my soul, that I am not everything that you want and that you can't be honest."

Tonight as I try to sleep, all I want to do is talk to you and wish we could be friends once again... But I'm not sure if I can. Instead here we are, not talking, and in my case, not falling asleep fast enough."

summer,Victoria,w4m,ReRe What I wanted to say - w4m,"Aw, you guys!Call me a silly romantic, but honestly there aren't enough guys who are man enough to show their feelings (yes, we consider that more manly and brave than knowing you feel that way and watching you pretend not to).  The ones who actually admit that they feel something more than lust for one woman are the exception, and we will never think less of a guy for saying something so ballsy.I'm tellin you, tell her/them.  Even if it's not reciprocated, you'll know that you made a woman you care about feel absolutely wonderful, and she won't be able to help thinking of you warmly forever afterward lol.A one line text could change everything.  Open the door.Good luck guys, I'm rooting for ya. :)"

I really like you a lot. That's why I invited you over"" is what I meant to say that night. I tried to be somebody who I wasn't anymore that night and was so confused as to what I should do and say I screwed things up. At least the food was nice. I could never bring myself to tell YOU how I felt about you. Everybody else knew. A lot of people tried to help by dropping hints to you and telling me things you liked. I had a lot of things going on in my life. I was confused with where I could or should take my life.  I guess these are excuses. Or they were at the time. I've learnt from that. I learnt a lot from failing what could have been a great friendship or maybe more who knows. I do know I miss your company a lot. You'll probably know who you are by reading this and please know, my heart was in the right place. My head wasn't. If anyone who knew me was asked they'd tell you that I over think everything. If you asked them how I felt about you they would call me an idiot for the things I didn't say to you. It wasn't for a lack of trying to drop hints though. I don't know why I'm posting this. You probably won't see this and that's fine. I've been told you're happy and that's all that matters. You deserve it. You are the most beautiful person I've met inside and out. I always felt your smiling face was my light in the darkness so to speak. Even though we weren't as close as I would have wanted us to be I still couldn't find myself advancing with any other. I still feel that way. Maybe by expressing these feeling to the world in a way might bring closure and acceptance that you are with another. It's been almost a week since I seen a post on here that seemed quite coincidental to the situation we were in,that's had my head in blender since.  I had to reply somehow. Wether it was you or not. I hope this doesn't change our friendship. If it does I pray for the better, not that you jump in my arms but for acknowledgment. Acceptance is all I ask for. I am a changed person and I can prove that.  By odins beard should it be you, should you reply. You'll tell me where the hellions are.P.S. I still owe you the dessert course of our meal. It was made. Also forgotten."

I feel like each of us makes the other act awkwardly when we talk, purely because of some kind of magnetism. Or, maybe it is the world's worst misread on my part. Or. . .maybe it's that we are both nerd introverts who are just awkward, period. You strike me as the type of person who might regularly read ""Missed Connections"" to gain an air of bliss in observing others' star cross'd plights -- never, ever expecting to see one written about you. If we were the same age, and neither of us were in a relationship, and if we did not work together, and if I could muster the courage, you'd still be out of my league, for you are the epitome of stunning and clever grace, whereas I am just regular. But I would woo you. You are Juliet and I am Mark. You actually remind me of her, except you are prettier. Enough. Enough now."

I thought you where a openly older gay man flirting with me. I remember this bus ride we where on together. You where far away but I kept seeing that you where watching me and would look away when I looked back. There a thing where when a gay guy is paying close attention to you and they copy what your doing. I remember tapping my foot and you started doing the same thing then when I stopped you would stop. It got to the point you looked at me trying to stop copying me and right when we got off the bus the first thing you wanted to do was say hello to me. At that point I was sure you liked me and I wanted to make a move but one day you came in I met your wife... it was so awkward because not once have we talked about any wife..or about girls. It was even more awkward because it was like she new or something she picked up on the way we talked, looked at one another, maybe your bi and she knows that but whatever it was she was rubbing all up on you that day saying how much she loves you and I remember you being awkward about it and I could see you where embarrassed.

summer,Barrie,m4w,My Beauty in Oro Part II - m4w,"Something I've been able to do with relative ease my entire life has now become the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  I've feared rejection and used that as a crutch to avoid expressing how I feel.  I've feared expressing how I feel because I felt there was no way the person I was attracted to could ever be attracted to me on the same level or to the same extent.  I've feared expressing my emotions because I believed I didn't deserve the love or affection of the person I was attracted to.  The more I got hurt and the more some of the fears were realized; the easier it got to hide and suppress my feelings.  The easier it got to suppress my feelings; the more I tried to legitimize my fears.  All that has changed because of you!When I see you; I feel like every single ounce of emotion I have is on display for all to see.  When I talk with you I think the whole world can read what the expression on my face is saying.  When I hug you I believe everyone can hear my silent expressions of complete happiness.  When I talk about you I believe my thoughts, feelings and emotions are transparent!!You bring out emotions I haven't felt in years!!  You bring out feelings I haven't wanted to express in a long time!!  You do this with ease by simply being who you are.  You do this and I don't think you even realize you're doing it.  You do this and I believe you are oblivious to the effect you have on me!!My day can't begin without a good morning text to you.  My day can't end without a good night to you.  My day doesn't seem complete unless I've seen your smile and heard your voice.  My worst days are instantly better when I look into your eyes or see your smile or hear your voice.  My happiest days are happier and more complete when I see your smile or hear your voice.  But my fears are realized every time I have to say goodbye.  My fears are made real every time I know I won't see you.  I will never be able to truly express the depth of my feelings for you.  I can try but I just don't think it's possible.  I think I have a grasp on how I feel but when we share a conversation or a hug or a look and I realize there still more to how I feel.  I think I've reached an understanding on my feelings and you do something that makes me realize there's still more love for me to give.  I don't feel jealousy in the truest sense of the word but I do feel a degree of jealousy when I think of you.  I'm jealous that others can enjoy your company more than I can.  I'm jealous that another person gets to feel you sleeping beside them.  I'm jealous that another person get to enjoy hours of quiet time with you every day.  I'm jealous that others get to enjoy hours of happy times with your every day.  I'm jealous that others get to enjoy the unconditional love and affection you offer every day.  I'm jealous because he hasn't got a clue what he has in you !!  All that being said; if you're truly happy then I'm happy for you but dying inside"

summer,Barrie,m4w,My beauty in Oro - m4w,"I know you'll likely never see this and while I've told you how I've felt many times; you will never fully understand just how much I love you and how much I'd do to make you smile.I've tried letting you go but I can't!  I've tried ignoring what I feel but I can't!  I've tried to suppress how I feel but I can't!  I've tried to cut those feelings loose knowing I'll never get to experience all I want to with you but I can't!  I can't do any of that and I'm sorry!  I'm not sorry for feeling how I feel.  I'm not sorry for feeling what I feel.  I'm not sorry for telling you how I feel.  I'm not sure why I'm sorry but I am.  I see too many situations where the love and devotion you show to others is not returned.  I hear you tell me how special I make you feel and I wonder why others can't do the same for you?  I hear you tell me how often I make you smile and I again wonder why others don't make the same effort to make sure you smile.  I see you look at me and can't for a second believe it's just a look.  Your eyes are so transparent to me and I see something in your eyes that tells me you atleast share some of the same feelings I do.  I see that look and it makes me feel like the most important man in the world at that time.  I hear your voice and it takes me to place of peace and happiness.  I feel your arms around me and at that moment there is no safer place anywhere.  I feel my arms around and it's a feeling I can't describe; I don't want to let go and I don't want that moment to end !!As long as you need me; you will always be my friend.  Should you ever have nobody; I will be there.  Should you ever need anything; if I can provide it I will.  Whether I like it or not; my heart will carry a torch for you for some time."

You asked if I could do you the favour of letting you have a week to sort out my life, before I try this again. You walked me back to my place, and warmed up enough to feel your body again. Then left cold saying you had work in the morning.  You didn't seem very fazed by what just happened. Although you were convulsing from the cold. It was a good week, lots of good memories (like tricycling). I was in the same pile of crap after the week, but you helped be get a plan together plan, and be a stronger person to take it on. I stuck to the plan we made. I had my daughter and made emends with my family and friends. The plans complete. I am no longer the person that I so desperately didn't want to be.

You really are an amazing person. When we walked passed your friends they mentioned that they herd you fell into the river and you played it off like you just fell in, so they wouldn't put the pieces together and judge me. I walk by your place often to take a peak, but your house was sold. I just want you to know that I'm very thankful. You are so amazing. My baby was a girl, I named her Leah after you.

summer,Niagara Region,m4m,Brown guy at the gym - if only - m4m,"I see you at the gym often, always in the afternoon. You wear a sleeveless hoodie, gym pants, and your headphones. Out of all the guys at the gym, your physique is the one I admire the most. Your arms are incredibly big, and well defined - as is the rest of your body. You chest is huge, bulging at the fabric of your hoodie, and so well rounded. I am envious of the progress you've made, but it is clear that you have worked hard for it. A couple of times I found myself walking into the locker room after a workout, to find you standing at your locker completely naked. It's so refreshing to see a straight man who is not ashamed to show off his body, or afraid that gay men would ""check them out"" as every straight man seems to think. Your butt is perfectly round and just a tad lighter shade of your dark olive complexion. I've tried a few times, with no luck, to catch a glimpse of your penis, but I am sure it is magnificent. I have fantasized about the possibility of kneeling behind you while you are standing at your locker, and spreading your perfectly shaped butt-cheeks, catching a waft of your sweaty manly scent after a long workout. I wonder what it would taste like to bring my tongue to your tight hole and slowly caress it, licking around the hole. I picture you submitting in pleasure, grasping at the lockers in ecstasy. I wonder what it would be like if you were to turn around, and face me with your thick, juicy, uncut (I presume) cock. The hot precum and foreskin emitting such an arousing musk. I would take it in one hand, pull back the foreskin and take your giant cock in my mouth. I'd work the shaft as I suck on the tip, slipping my hand in between your muscular legs and playing with your hole, still wet from my spit. Do you have any idea how good it feels to have a finger slide into your hole while having your cock sucked? I imagine your legs would be shaking with pleasure at this point, and you sit down, while i continue to suck on your manhood, caressing your muscularly sculpted upper body, and running my fingers on your inner thighs. If you were to cum -  loudly - I'd take it all in my mouth, swallowing every last drop of your man-juice, as if it could magically give me a tenth of the body you have. I get up to leave, you nod out of breath, and chuck your sweaty, wet, musky underwear at me. I take a sniff where your huge cock and balls would have been, wink at you, and leave. Only if..."

I forgive, although this man continues his actions... I've broken hearts, ruined lives, destroyed homes and yet my past follows me around in my new life... Why is this, does not one person have the cahoonies to face me? What is a life worth.? SILENCE DOES NOT MEAN LYING, GIVING INDIRECT MESSAGES,,,, I CAN'T FORGIVE MYSELF FOR MY ACTIONS AND BEING REMINDED OF THEM DAILY BY COWARDS AND CHICKEN SHITS, JUST PUSHES ME CLOSER TO THE EDGE... THANK GOD FOR REAL MEN AND WOMEN WHO MAN NOT LIVE THE ""PERFECT LIFE"" BUT AT LEAST CAN ADMIT TO THEIR ACTIONS AND MAKE THEMSELVES ACCOUNTABLE... you know my name. you've forced me to say I trust you... You allow hate to consume me . AND YOU'LL ALLOW MY FATHER TO PASS THINKING I MADE IT ALL UP. MY MOTHER AS WELL... I SIMPLE AM DONE CARING. I'VE DONE PRAYING THAT A COWARD AND A DESTROYER OF MARRIAGES AND RELATIONSHIPS AND THE ONLY ONE  ALL-KNOWING AND POWERFUL SEEKER OF JESUS TO ADMIT TO THEIR SINS... WELL YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE... THE DARK KNIGHT MAY FORGIVE BUT HE WILL NEVER FORGET. SO TO ALL THOSE WHO THREATEN TO CALL THE PIGS ON ME, WHEN YET THEY HAVE DONE SO MUCH WORSE TO ME... GO AHEAD GIVE ER' TITS... BUT REMEMBER SOMEDAY I MAY BE BACK AND I'LL HAVE MY GIANT SILVER SPOON TO SHOVE UP YOUR ASS. In closing to my missed connection outwest... I WILL LOVE THE RAYNE FOREVER..... BUT NOT AS MUCH AS I WILL ALWAYS LOVE AND REMEMBER THE WORDS.. HI, MY NAME IS SHAR AND THIS IS MY CAR... EVEN THAT WHOLE STATEMENT WAS A LIE.. I SIMPLY FELL IN LOVE AT FIRST SITE AND IT WAS AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL... SHE WAS NEVER MINE AND THE BEST THING IS THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER... I WOULDN'T CHANGE THE PAST AT ALL..

She may have expressed an interest in writing screenplays in the horror, science-fiction and action genres if you've spoken with her.

I will have to admit i was sensually doing myself really good , teasing myself to cummm really close and then stopping and starting again until i came really hard all over a towel that was in my car from my swim at the club . Being done i naturally got outta my car and started into the store when i heard the SUV- that was parked next to me- start up and backed out ... i immediately freaked as i knew whoever was in it saw EVERYTHING i just did , FUCK i thought but just then as they drove away the window rolled down and from the inside a female voice shouted "" FUCKING HOT "" as she stuck her arm out the window and waved good bye as she drove off and headed towards the street. ... In an instance i was both embarrassed and turned on - but mostly turned on - so here i am looking for that girl or girls who watched me stroke my cock until i creamed all over myself and wondering if they might like to watch me do it again ( since the cat is outta the bag now ) ... if you see this tell me what i was driving so i know it is you or ""you's"" so we can ""maybe"" try doing this again ...btw...TOTALLY HOT !!ps.

summer,Ottawa-Hull-Gatineau,m4w,You Said Spring Was A Promise - m4w,"Dear Miss, It's a shame I never learned your name. We met for a brief moment on a spring afternoon, the breeze scattered the petals of pink blossoms from the trees, and your blue floral print dress billowed as our eyes met. You smiled at me. I was lost. I've been lost ever since in a wistful daydream. You have tousled blonde hair that blew into your face and your eyes are as green as spring grass. You are in your mid-twenties, I believe but maybe you're younger or older. I couldn't tell. Does beauty defy age or does age defy beauty? When we spoke, your voice was a soft soprano song. I am far less impressive. I wore black jeans, a black jacket, and dark sunglasses. I weigh more than I'd like to but getting back into shape for summer means eating less and exercising more than I like to but I'll get around to it eventually. I told you about my career in the arts and how at twenty-five I'm not where I wanted to be. I've cut my light brown hair since we met. We talked about the book you were reading, The Ocean At The End Of The Lane by Neil Gaiman, and I told you of my obsession with his work, Shakespeare, and the playwrights Artaud and Brecht. You said you liked spring because it was a promise that brighter days were ahead and it had never broken its promise. I like spring because of the rain; the overcast gunmetal sky always inspires the gloomiest and most macabre pieces of art and those have always been my favourite. After our conversation, you pointed me in the direction I needed to go and I went, walking away from you with a goodbye. But I didn't forget the moment. Moments are special because they don't conform to the rules of time, they last as long as they need to, and stay with us when time passes by. Sometimes a moment isn't enough and like spring, the one we shared felt like a promise that we could have brighter and better moments in the future.I walked away from you that day. I'm hoping to find my way back."

summer,Ottawa-Hull-Gatineau,m4w,crazy neighbour - m4w,"My neighbour is a crazy bitch, a sort of inverted manic-depressive and a witch combined into one being. She can be so sweet and feminine and kind and within a few minutes she becomes a monster, spitting and spewing hate and threats. I have never seen her back garden behind the 8ft fence but she spends a lot of time working on it, apparently planting flowers and shrubs and maybe even vegetables.One day lately, as I returned home from being out with a whore I periodically bang, I noticed that my neighbours gate ajar, so slyly I stealthly approached it, stopping to listen at first in case she was inside working. All being silent I peered inside and was shocked at what I saw. There were rows and rows of what I can only describe as grave-like mounds, with flowers and shrubs at the head of each one. To ensure my eyes were not deceiving me, I took a few photos with my phone and hurried on home. Once home, I studied the photos and upon enlargment, I could identify names on small plagues on each mound, They were all mens names with a heart engraved beside the name. Deciding to bring the matter up with my neighbour would be a matter of timing, so I brought a few bottles of what seemed her wine of choice, judging by the contents of her recycling bin and asked her if she would like to come over to my place and share in my happy news later that evening. She arrived looking stupendous, classy and extremely sexy. As we sat and had some hors d'ouvres I had prepared and drank wine, we talked warnly about life, my good news and her love of gardening. I have to admit, she can handle liquor vey well. Eventually she asked me if I enjoyed my first view of her garden, well I was agast and had no idea what to say, however, I remained calm and said yes that I had found it to be fascinating and unusual. She laughed and teased me about it's purpose and design and then she dropped to her knees in front of me and revealing her large, firm chesticles, she opened my pants and taking my member in her mouth she gave me an exquisite bobby jones and when I came she had it all gathered in her cheeks and she bolted to her garden and digging frantically she spewed the fresh sperm into the fresly dug hole and then covered it up. She later came back to my place to finish her wine and explained that what she did was necessary as she wanted to grow her own children. I thanked her for the blow and she said that I was welcome.As she walked out my front door I watched her leave and her stature, long hair and movements were amazing, but what a fucking nut case."

I couldn't focus on what I was doing and you kept staring in my direction. I actually mistakenly honked my horn at one point lol.

summer,Ottawa-Hull-Gatineau,m4w,Around Town - m4w,"I wasn't sure if I should post this, but after awhile of seeing other posts, I thought, why not.See, I'm a person that is extremely visible, and active in the community, especially in the downtown area. I can be spotted from pretty far away. The reason for this is quite simple. I drive around in a big powered wheelchair.Almost everywhere I go, people often stare at me. I no longer mind, in fact, I'm used to it. To me, it tells me that you're at least curious about who or what I am. Sadly, my presence often intimidates people, and makes some feel uneasy around me, which is understandable. If I saw someone booting around town driving a mini tank, I'd be kinda freaked out too.Anyways, I'm here to tell you all that it's ok, there's no reason to feel intimidated, or shy around me. Even though, I may look and sound different, I'm really just a regular guy. You can talk to me, and I'm very good at carrying a conversation, and I have a lot of interests. If you want, you can even ask about my disability, if it's in a respectable manner.I can't speak for all physically disabled people, but generally speaking, we're pretty easy going people.The same goes for me as well.I'm VERY approachable, but I'm kind of shy when it comes to approaching others. You may be missing out on getting to know someone who's truly unique.I also want to say thank you to anyone that has held a door opened for me, or anything like that. It can be tough getting around the city, so I truly appreciate any help offered.Don't be shy."

summer,Ottawa-Hull-Gatineau,w4m,Re: You are so hot and cold... - w4m,"Maybe you're hot and cold too and you don't even notice it?Actions read louder than words. Crossing your arms while talking to someone indicates that your on the defensive or feeling threatened. Avoiding eye contact when talking to someone is often an indication that someone's being dishonest.  Disappearing without a trace or not responding to messages indicates that you're not interested.So why should I approach you?Maybe the reason I'm not making a move is because I feel you don't know what you want..."
summer,Ottawa-Hull-Gatineau,w4m,Oh you... - w4m,"You keep crossing my mind, even though we just  a few weeks ago. I have no idea if you  feel the same way, but it's all good. You're a cool guy and maybe I will have enough courage to tell you in person the next time we chill. Until then..."

Two weeks ago, I met this guy and we had some fun together and he suggested that I join his 3 buddies and himself for a trip up to their fishing cabin in west Quebec. Kind of hesitated, but the thought of it was pretty exciting and they were all pretty hot looking guys. Ended up having some of the best group sex ever. While they were out doing their thing during the day, I  stayed at the cabin and took care of things when they got back. Never knew where that lake (wont say name) was, but sure wont forget it now!"

You had overhead something I was looking for, and we had a rather comical conversation regarding Jazz.  Thought you were quite handsome and would like to meet again."
summer,Ottawa-Hull-Gatineau,w4m,Can't Let Go - w4m,"I miss you and I regret having questioned whether we were meant to be together. I promised myself that I'd stop talking to you. I just wanted you to know that it's not because I am angry at you for what you said to me last. I got your apology. I just realize that it hurts both of us so much more when we keep talking. I also just wanted you to know that this whole time I've just been trying to pluck on your heartstrings so you might give me another chance. You are much more stubborn than I ever realized. The last time I saw you I was naively full of hope that you might reconsider your position, but I didn't want to bug you so I just babbled on about all the positive changes I've been trying to make in my life. I could see you wilting though, so I decided it was best if I made a speedy retreat even though all I could think about was how much like home it felt to be in your house talking to you like always and wishing I could kiss you and hug you like I used to when you were mine :'( I wish it hadn't ended this way. I enjoyed our time together so much despite our problems. I really did think we'd spend our life together. I was at my happiest when we'd day dream about our future together and when you said you wanted to marry me someday. I regret that day that I told you that what I saw for our future had become an image in my mind of you coming home from a twelve hour day and working more when you got home while I was still depressed and didn't want to get out of bed. I couldn't stop fearing that we'd end up resenting each other. It seems to me that it was that expressed thought that scared you into wanting to break up for good. I've been kicking myself ever since. I never should have said it out loud. Perhaps I was right about it, but I still can't help but feel that we didn't exhaust all of our options. I still felt hopeful that we could make it work. I still love you, teddy bear. I wish you'd come back to me."

I can't handle hearing your voice, seeing your face or being near you without my body tingling. I try to avoid you but it never seems to work.  This is by far the worst feeling in the world and I keep telling myself that it'll pass or go away, but it never does. Every time is like the first time."

More than anything else it's just me yelling into the void a little bit.Somewhere you're out there. And I really wish you'd bloody find me. It seems like every time I think I've found that awesome forever someone it turns out she's not you. She's someone who figures out (usually after I'm emotionally invested) she needs to be on her own. Figure stuff out.And my world feels like someone changed all the gravity. But you, you're smart and nerdy. Warm and loving. You're together and you know what you want. When things get serious you'll be ready and capable of handling it. You're out there somewhere. Could you maybe find me somehow?"

I wish you'd check in on me, but I doubt that will happen.  I guess I just have a chronic problem being wrong and making the wrong choices.

I'm alone and yes it is my choice, but it's not what I really want. It's how I cope. As you said many times, you know me like no other and you do, oh so very well. I am truly sorry for all the pain, frustration and hurt I have caused, yet again. I've tried to make you angry to make it easier to forget me and I haven't really reached out as per your wishes, so you can move on and find what you truly need. But I need you to know that I told you what you wanted to hear not how what is true -- that I did not love you. But that's so far from the damn truth and you know it. I'm scared about what the future has in store, whether I could ever provide enough emotionally for you. That's why I run when I get overwhelmed as you know, that's what I've always done. I just want you to know that I love you so very much and always will. My life is so void without you. I've not just lost the best lover, but my best friend as well. You will always be my one true love for the rest of my life, that I do know."

summer,Ottawa-Hull-Gatineau,m4w,"Someday, maybe - m4w","Remembering a specific, special girl - M.V.We were never together, but that's probably for the best. You've probably moved away. You've long since graduated. If you knew how I felt, you never let on, and sometimes I wonder.Sometimes I don't care. Sometimes that isn't the point.You're the reason I believe in love at first sight. And from that awkward introduction to the awkward friendship that followed, I was never certain I was doing anything right. I doubted myself every step. Maybe that was my mistake.But in my mind, there you are. The lines of your face are etched in me like a river through a canyon. Your eyes, like a dark forest, so tempting and yet I wouldn't dare look too closely for fear of becoming lost. And that smile. Just... I wish I knew you better. We drifted apart, and I didn't fight it for fear of losing you forever. For fear of smothering you, of keeping you from being *you.* I had faith that we'd meet again. Maybe I still do. It's like a broken leg. Someday, it might heal. And until then... I'll just take it easy. Take things slow. Give myself room to recover, so when we bump into each other, a happy surprise, I'll be good enough and strong enough to be worthy of your attention.And maybe it won't happen. Maybe I'll find someone else. Maybe you're already married, on a path to greatness parallel to my own destination. Maybe I'll be as happy as you are, in the arms of another. Maybe the memories will one day be all I need.Maybe.Someday."

Just the kind of person you were. We then dated for a period in high school. Through the magic of the web, we managed to get together a couple times over the years. The last time being about three years ago. I feel that I must say something here, as I've lost the means to contact you over the years.You always seemed interested..but did not seem to act. That rain soaked evening a few years ago caught me off guard. I came to town expecting something completely different although what we shared together was quite fantastic. I must apologize for being so empty or indifferent. I feel that in some way I contributed to the way you have become, or became? You seem to be wrapped up in an online world, an online world that has long since been out-dated. I'm not sure if this is where you will find true happiness, but if it is what makes you happy then go for it. We met awkwardly a couple of years back, I had recently bought my truck and drove you home from work at NY fries, do you still work there?The reason I am posting this is that, I am getting married in the fall. I finally did find someone whom makes me happy, and truly is my best friend. I really hope you have found the same. You're a beautiful and fantastic person, Jess, here's to our futures...perhaps we will meet again some day."

The one that I let go. I regreted leaving you at the time. It ate at me for years. I was angry at first because I was expecting more from our relationship. I was expecting more from you. I thought we were going to settle down and you maybe wanted to as well. As soon as I was on another shift it put a strain on our already strained relationship. I felt I was no longer what you wanted to be with. I felt you lost interest me. It was fine that I was never going to be good enough for your family. Never matter to me as long as I was good for you and you were good for me. Sometimes I kick my self in the ass for being self distructive. Ended up hurting a lot of people in the process. I wish I could have told you the truth. About how I was feeling instead of trying to hurt you or get you to fight for me. After awhile I didn't believe you cared but believe me I know why.This is in the past. I don't want this eating me up anymore. I don't want beat myself up anymore or think of things that I could have done different. In the end the result would have been the same. This was never going to work out cause if it was we would be together. That's not happening! I'm happier. I felt like I was  breaking down at the end. I put you through enough back then to with everything going on I'm surprised you didn't kill someone. Find someone you actually want. Don't get trap to a loser or someone you don't really want."

They seemed to say, I will float lightly,And peruse, let it brush me slightly, maybe I'll keep a residueof the possible as I pass through. Unfortunately, you were the flint that struck a fire in me,and the fuel it burns is rooted so deep.Not just another face in the crowd, yours is a light I want to keep.In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni.Let it take me, it feels right. I gladly fall into the fantasy,to drive with you into the night, along the ancient hills of Spain. A storm on the horizon, we go until we feel the rain.Blackbough come back now. Or garlic will never be the same for me!  - Kyoutube.com  /watch?v=EQZlaUw0U5g"

summer,Montreal,w4m,SOLITUDE - w4m,"SOLITUDELaugh and the world will laugh with you; Weep and you will weep alone; For the sad old earth cries its own tears and it has enough troubles on its own. Sing and the hills will answer; sigh and it is lost on the air; the echoes bound to a joyful sound, but shrink from voicing care.Rejoice and men will seek you; Grieve and they will go;They want full measure of all your pleasure, but they do not need your woe, Be glad and your friends will be many; be sad and you will lose them all, None will decline your wine, but alone you will have to take life's fall.Feast and your halls will be crowded; Fast and the world will go by.Succeed and give cause it will keep you alive, but no man will help you die. There is plenty of room in the halls of pleasure, its a large and crowded train, but one by one we must file in line through the narrow aisles of pain."
summer,Montreal,w4m,A connection between strangers. - w4m,"They never met, but they were in love. They had a soul connection, even if it was only through words. It was a strange relationship, the kind that just happens and you get lost in it. The kind that slowly takes over your mind, body and soul without you realizing it. They had a lust for each other that was overwhelming, an obsession for one another that was consuming. But was it real? He was driven by his desires and she was driven by her heart. They were a match made in heaven, but they chose to remain apart. Strangers.I understand now that this was a story about lonely people, about absence and loss, and I had taken refuge in it until I became confused with my own life. Like someone who escapes into the pages of a novel, I loved the mystery and possibilities of the characters, but they were rarely real. When you fantasize about something too much, reality is bound to ruin it. Fantasies are built on perfection, reality is not. Don't live in your head, built things realistically. Its weird to constantly think about someone you don't know. You try to forget about them, but the mystery keeps pulling you back in. Its a push and pull. Just because an opportunity wasn't taken, doesn't mean it wasn't lost."

I grow up overhearing girls bitch and moan and whine about how much of a jackass this guy is or how shallow guys are and I'd think ""well we aren't all this way"" But now some years later not much has changed except I've had a realization, females are worse than the guys they bitch about.You're more shallow than a kiddie pool, I see ads and profiles here and there where the woman is fat and she demands a fit guy? Really? So be yourself is never true then?!As a guy I guess I have a few choices.Lose my weight, get my cock sized increased because god knows how important that is, earn tons of money or become a drug addict, disrespect woman and never respect one again and only view them as a walking pair of breasts and pussy.Or just give up, completely, someone like me wasn't built for a world where love doesn't exist so why bother, I used to hide in my room 24/7 that was 2 years ago now, I better my own life, gain some dreams and hope and for what?To realize I will die alone, there is no such thing as truly loving someone despite flaws I mean I would but there is only one me. Guess I'll just revert then."

For a couple of days after that, I couldn't stop thinking about you, and it drove me insane! That's how I am, I don't fall often, but when I do, I fall hard. So I kept going after you, even though I knew it was a bad idea. Roles aren't supposed to be reversed.We didn't spend much time together, but those few encounters were enough. What pulled me towards you was your quiet strength, and how genuinely good, caring a person you are. You mentioned that you were hurting, and I felt the urge to comfort you, make it all go away, but I saw the distance in your eyes, and held back. Maybe that was a mistake. . .I know someday you will make one lucky girl very happy, and I'm hoping she will return in kind. Sadly, this girl won't be me, I'm just the hook up after all, the one you spend a few hours in bed with, before invoking some later commitment you have to tend to. And it gnaws at me, seeing you leave every time, it makes me feel unworthy, unlovable.I know we agreed it would be casual, no strings attached, but I just can't help myself. So before I get too close to the fire, I'm choosing to pull away. Be well!"

summer,Saskatoon,m4w,"Saskatoon Transit, bus route 3 - m4w","I saw you on the city bus yeasterday.I was wearing a blue-striped  short sleeve button up and jeans. You were wearing a vintage red skirt and a smart white blouse. You got on at Place Reil on campus and sat across from me and we made eye contact, briefly. I fell in love with you a little bit, in that stupid way where you completely make up a fictional version of the person you're looking at and fall in love with that person. Several times we looked at each other and then looked away. I tried to think of something to say to you -- maybe pretend I didn't know where I was going and ask you for directions or say something nice about your earrings, or just say, ""Hot day."" It all seemed so stupid.At one point, I caught you staring at me and you immediately averted your eyes. You pulled a book out of your bag and started reading it -- a biography of Candy Darling- but I noticed you never once turned a page.My stop was on McKercher I decided to stay on, rationalizing that I could just get off after the bus went all around East College Park and back on McKercher off of DeGeer, but then I didn't get off after DeGeer either. You must have missed your stop as well, because when we got all the way to the end of the line at the Center Mall, we both just sat there in the bus, waiting.I cocked my head at you inquisitively. You shrugged and held up your book as if that was the reason.Still I said nothing.We took the bus all the way back down -- down Acadia thru Wildwood around Boychuck back down McKercher to Sutherland, down 108 th back to the University and thru to Down town. I knew I had to say something.Still I said nothing.And so we went back up.Back up the Number 3 bus route. We caught the rush hour crowds down town and then saw them thin out again at the end of the line at Center mall again. I gave myself deadlines: I'll talk to her before we cross the river,I'll talk to her before we get back on campus. Still I remained silent.I kept waiting for that tiny gesture could have been enough to pivot us into a conversation, but there in stupid silence still we sat.There were times when we were the only two souls on the bus and even then I felt self-conscious about bothering you. She's reading her book, I thought, she doesn't want to talk to me. Still, there were moments when I felt a connection. Someone would shout something crazy about Jesus and we'd immediately look at each other to register our reactions. A couple of teenagers would exit, holding hands, and we'd both think: Young Love.For hours we sat on that bus, just barely pretending not to notice each other. I got to know you so well, if only peripherally. I memorized the curves of your body, the contours of your face, the patterns of your breath. Eventually you stood up as the bus pulled up to 8th St on Acadia. You hesitated briefly there, perhaps waiting for me to say something, giving me one last chance to stop you, but rather than spit out hours of suppressed almost-conversations I said nothing, and I watched you slip out between the closing  doors.It took me a few more stops before I realized you were really gone. I kept waiting for you to reenter the bus sit down next to me, grab my hand and rest your head on my shoulder.When the bus returned to 8th street from the mall, I craned my neck as we passed where you got off. Perhaps you were there, At the stop,still waiting. Perhaps I would see you, smiling and bright, your hair waving in the wind.But no, you were gone. And I realized most likely I would never see you again. And I thought about how amazing it was to spend that entire afternoon with you, knowing for those hours we were both so filled with anticipation we could have burst. Well at least I was.Thank you for that afternoon, for the rest of my days I will think of you ,I will think of how I felt  and how the intensity grew to a want I've never felt so strong before , who knows if I will ever feel again.If by chance you happen to read this, you can find me out in Saskatoon on weekend nights watching live music. There is a 99% chance of running into me if the band Gong Show is performing in town."

You were wearing shorts and a t-shirt that said ""Lift"" on the right sleeve. You were pretty short (not trying to be rude haha) and with a friend, but we made eye contact a few times. I was with a small group of friends near the stall you were ordering at. I doubt you'll see this, but I think you're really cute and wish I asked for your # when I saw you so I wouldn't have to write a creepy post like this on craigslist haha. Anyways, not sure if people really reply to posts like these, but if your this girl, I'd love to hit up the Night Market again with you some time!I don't know how I'd identify you, but maybe send me your Instagram page or something?

The more I think about it, I don't I was. I was so at a loss for response at the time. Maybe it was because your infectiously sexy attitude, or your gorgeous eyes and smile, or the image of your beautiful breasts in your bathing suit as you would lean down to give my dog attention, or maybe it was the tattoo I saw on your rear side as I said goodbye... I just was at a loss for words.I know there is quite the age gap, but I'd love to bring my dog over again, soon. Just tell me what breed he was in the subject line!"

summer,Vancouver,w4m,'borrowed' your skateboard in 2008. want to return it :) - w4m,"In 2008 I met a guy out drinking one night. Me and the girl I was with ended up going back to the guys place. I had sex with the guy I met, and my friend waited for me in the living room with the room mate. After the hook up, I wanted to get the hell out of there, me and my girl headed for the door...... and on my way out I grabbed a skateboard that was propped up by the door. Then I ran outta there as fast as possible. I thought it was the most hilarious thing at the time. But eventually I sobered up and felt guilty. I know it's not right to take something that's not mine from someone else for a laugh.I've been hanging on to it since then, taking good care of it. Only rode it a few times. It's still in great condition. I even replaced the wheels and bearings. I want to return it to the rightful owner. I hope he sees this... or if this story sounds like it happened to your friend, forward it.I can't post a picture of the skateboard because I need you to describe it to me so I don't give it away to just anyone.

summer,Vancouver,m4w,Red Haired Angel - 6 Years - m4w,"Dear K,I'm sure you'll never read this, but I need to express my feelings somehow, even anonomously, as I still can't find the courage to break the awkwardness. Before I begin, please forgive me if I embarass you, even if I probably don't deserve to be forgiven, for the way I acted towards you. I truly hope that you do not think of me as some creep, or pathetic, desperate stalker, but simply as a caring broken-hearted man, whose heart you still hold from when he was a fresh-faced 18 year old boy.We first met almost six years ago in University, when I was invited to your floor by your RA, on behalf of a girl there, whom I had always guessed was you, from the way you blushed when I showed up. I still clearly remember that beautiful sweet smile you had and how you invited me to come back and hang out after our first meeting. I remember when we completed our first math assignments together, after everyone else left, and how on Friday nights we watched movies together along with others. Often we would be the first ones, and occasionally the only ones in the cafeteria at 7:15am.You used to frequently wave and smile at me from across a crowded lecture hall. Your face would light up and your amazing green eyes would look upon me as you formed the most wonderful smile I've still yet to see equaled to this day. Maybe I just mistook kindness for affection, but I had hoped and thought that there maybe was something more, that just maybe you were fond of me. We grew apart after this, as I stopped showing up, due to commitments, homework, and largely my own neglect. I could never find the words to speak my true feelings towards you, and if I had this time to live over, I would certainly have spent more time with you, even if it was just as a friend, as that smile would bring happiness to the most miserable day.We met again, months later, at the end of school, and despite the time that had passed, you still showed me that same wonderful, sweet smile. We walked back from a meeting together, and you still seemed so interested in talking with me, even after not talking for months. We were interested in the same subjects, and definitely had similar interests. As we walked back together, you continued to smile and blush at me, and you showed me so much attention, even if I didn't deserve it. Again, maybe you were just showing kindness to a friend, but it seemed like there was maybe something more, that you genuinely liked me, even if I didn't deserve to be with you. When we arrived at your building, I so wanted to ask you out, or in some way speak my feelings for you, but all I managed was to ask if I could see you again sometime, to which you smiled and said yes. Maybe it sounds pathetic and desperate, but you made that one of the happiest days of my life.We would see each other frequently over the next year at meetings, and I tried to stop and talk with you whenever I saw you at the table you had set up near where I lived, but again I was always too shy to tell you how I felt. I probably seemed vain and arrogant, and I probably was, but somewhere in there that blue-eyed boy just wanted to tell you how he felt, even if I couldn't figure out how or when. We were both invited to a formal dinner that school year, and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw you and you smiled at me, and at just how breathtakingly beautiful you were, but it was never your appearance alone that drew me to you, it was always above all else, your kindness that you always showed me. In the year after that, we saw each other less, as you were no longer in the same extracurricular program, although we did we share one class together. By that point, you usually ignored me, and I wasn't upset, since I probably deserved to be ignored, but I still hoped every time I would eventually see that wonderful smile with that blushing face I had seen two years earlier. I was a pathetic lonely guy, but I still thought about you, and hoped just maybe you might talk to me again, even if I had ignored your attention before and if you were ever interested in me, you had probably given up. On St. Patrick's Day I recall running into you at the bar as I was leaving, and it stirred up old feelings.In the next year, I only ran into you once, but you still waved and smiled at me as you done before years earlier, and I saw your eyes widen and your face light up. You were most probably just being friendly since we hadn't ran into each other in almost a year and I hadn't thought about you in a long time, but that day and for that month I had been slightly depressed for a variety of reasons, and you certainly would not have known it, but you probably brought some of the only happiness to me that week.We only saw each other one more time, over a year later, and nearly a year ago now. I'm certain you saw me look over at you as I was leaving with family, and as much as you probably thought I was a creep, or a stalker, or some pathetic and desperate combination of these, I simply looked to see a familiar face with that unforgettable red hair. You were with someone else, and as much as I honestly admit I was jealous, I knew it was none of my business, and I wasn't upset at you, as we hadn't seen each other in a year, and you had your own life to live, but instead I was upset at myself, filled with regret for never having expressed my true feelings towards you.I've wanted to talk to you since then and apologize for coming off as a creep, or a stalker or something, and to tell you that I never had anything but the best of intentions for you, but never had the courage. Even now I'm still a coward, and can only write out my feelings anonymously, in some vain delusion that maybe you might stumble upon this. You're probably in a happy, loving relationship with someone else, and in some way I'm happy for you, but nevertheless I can no longer deny or completely hide my feelings towards you. You very likely do not feel the same after all these years, and very possibly never did, but despite this, for some illogical, and irrational reason, I still have strong romantic feelings for you. They're probably misguided, pathetic, and desperate, but I just can't stop thinking about you, and how I missed my chance to tell you the truth, even if you would have rejected me. You were honestly one of the kindest, friendliest people I've ever met, and you showed me kindness even when I was fool who likely didn't deserve it. So, if in the slightest infinitesimal chance you found and read this confession, and felt anything at all, or even just want to talk as friends, you could make me incredibly happy again."

I dont usually do this and Im not even  sure also if people like you check out this site, and you are such a busy man too.       But I can't sleep yet and I will just give it a shot hoping you will ever see this. You know what, we are not that close but I am thinking about you the whole time while I was on my way home, up till now. I don't know why but I have been missing you a lot the past couple of days, and today I saw you again and I am happy as fuck! even though I am tired as hell doing things I'm not even used too but I'm trying just so I can still be near you somehow.

I really don't know if I could ever let you know the way I am feeling right now and that I really love to see you smile even though today I haven't seen you smile that much like the last time you were around but don't worry because you still look  lovely :) whether you smile or not hehe .   Hey, if there is anything I did that disappointed you, I'm sorry  okay. I don't know why i always panic and I couldn't think well every time our eyes meet I couldn't even react according to how I wanted to, I would want to give you a big smile but I could barely do enough..,  maybe because I am too anxious every time I see you. I'm sorry.  If ever you can read this, you don't have to reply if you don't feel like. I just want you to know that I  I heartily appreciate how nice you are to me despite how successful you are and that I'm so glad I met someone as awesome  as you. And even when I'm not around anymore  I will  still keep wishing you happiness and more success. As long as you are happy, is all that matters to me and  then I  can carry on achieving my own goals in life while still treasuring the short time I had spent there with you. I wish the best for you and to the people that you love. also  I hope you get enough rest everyday  coz don't want you to be sick <3. I will never forget you <3 <3"

God knows I haven't been fucked close to a year. I often wonder why you never made a move ? Anyway, my silk panties were soaking wet the whole time I sat next to you in that movie theatre. I have never had so much fun sitting next to a man in a theatre. I was just so fucking aware of your masculine presence, just itching to touch that muscular forearm; the glint of golden hair a stunning contrast to my thin and hairless one.

The crazed people in the passenger seat and back seat holding the terrified man out on the outside of the car as it sped past. I saw it first and gasped, then Rosie and Dawna looked over. They screamed, realizing the potential for a death. The man tumbled off the car down the block, in a horrific way,  we saw his legs and arms, in silhouette, backlit by the streetlight further on, flying around fast and uncontrollably.  We all looked at each other knowing that we had to go and help him, although we all presumed he was dead.Oort cloud zombie comets had been bombarding the dark side of earth for weeks now, sucked in by the gravity. Death rained down supreme, in a spectacular fireworks show. Only a few comets actually made landfall, but destruction and death were the results of many hits since the time the comet storms started hitting Earth. Death by comet came every twelve hours, screaming like banshees and exploding like bombs in the darkness of each night. A distant trumpeter seemed to know and understand his pain. The unknown musician's tone mingled strangely with the  counterpointed echoes, delayed almost into harmonies of the second and third parts. Sonic shards of the harder transients split into singular, tiny, tympanic resonances,  glancing off of the rusted fire escapes of N.D.G.. The sweeping accompaniment of the city scape and the somewhat random pulses of tactile, vapid spark lust, briefly lost and re-found in enclaves of the soul, bring to a boil the sad doom and puritan tonalities that spoke these words on the absent wind, ""...Shady! We just adore the new act! ...such a touch of heaven"". The dissonance grew as the tonalities  approached menacingly and ugly.The whole squad spoke like a combination of LasVegas and New York crime family. She is like an ad for sexiness. The cuts in the movie make no sense, there are strange phrases sitting way out in the middle of nowhere like an action scene in a romance movie, a love story amid lust machines. The screams of James Brown fill the radio airwaves.Go to heaven.Go to hell. When James Brown is singing you can't really tell."

I could not concentrate at work, or even show up sober. I wasent living up to my fullest potential. There was no more love left in my soul.  I did what I needed to do, I had to leave that town, breaking hearts never was my intention. Im sorry I left you there on your own, but I had to disappear for a little while.  I don't think youll ever forgive me for that. But I hope that you are on here, ive been reading these things ever since the new year, procrastinating wether I should post or not. A couple of times I even got on a bus to head back to Banff. But I didn't know how you would feel with me just showing up. I don't know what has happened to you over these last long months, but one thing I do know is I need to talk with you. Heal with you. I hope you feel the same way. At the time we said the feeling was mutual, but that was a lie on my part. I hope you can forgive me for this. Anyways, the bigger picture in a nutshell - I miss you terribly.

Lately it doesn't surprise me that you want that ugly, unhappy man in your life. I would never have believed, though, that you'd fall so low that you'd do exactly what he did, to inflict exactly the same feeling of helplessness and fear that made us move here in the middle of the night to a sweet young kid like my roomie. I know you're desperate to maintain some kind of power over me somehow, I get it, but how could you do that to J? He didn't do anything to you. Do you know you made him cry? He's just a fucking kid. What on earth have you become? In the end, you became everything about T that you hated. You're no different, no better than him at all. Part of me still hopes you don't end up where he is in life though. You could be so much better than this."

Who knows. . . sigh)====================================================================As soon as I stepped up into the plane yesterday evening (Sat 13 June), where you were greeting boarding pax, I felt my heart begin to flitter and my tummy get tickly in a way I haven't in years--a sort of sudden youthful excitement and desire that too rarely comes naturally from encountering a new stranger.You were friendly and bright, though professional and efficient. You looked broody and soft, too, in the resting moments between duties. Your eyes, your smile; they conjured something magical. (And the blonde suits you.)I so wanted to strike up a conversation, and sit down and buy you a drink right there, if only the presence of real life could fade away for a frozen little bit of time. Or at least contrive some conversation.But. . . I didn't.I don't know if it's couth to flirt with a flight attendant; maybe you get that all the time.Besides it was a tiny plane and a short flight, and any expression would be obvious.I instead resigned to keep to myself, and be a model anonymous passenger. I could only wonder and stew, disappearing on arrival to probably to never see you again.And afterwards. . . I rather regretted it.How's that for melted cheese? Anyway.

You purred so gently into my eager ear....and gave me shivers as I believed that you would find my missed connection all of those years ago. On that first blissful meeting, we spent so many hours together: me discovering you, and you unleashing my own kinks. It was then when I fell for you - such hope and sweet and filthy kindred spirits! Oh my!!I scrolled through the endless needs and wants you shared, as you tickled my fingertips with saucy desires. Yes, oh my god yes, I wanted more!! I put myself on full display for you....sharing my own kinky self....offering my entire being to you, my delicious partner in crime. I wanted all of my self to be seen. So wonderfully titillating! I closed my eyes and jumped in to you with my oversexed self.And the flood began...the dam was broken and there was no turning back. I wanted to feel you on me, in me as I was ready to open those scintillating notes from you.The first few felt like an awkward first encounter, but I persevered. Sometimes it felt like you were mocking my desire, but how could you? Look at all those promises you made to me with your words, paragraphs and pictures....so many pictures. You overwhelm me! A plethora of unexpected anatomy and physiology lessons!There is much I have learned from you, my dear.Your teasing was endless, and you never gave me a chance to share my authentic self with you. There were some very sensual and loving offerings I tried to make to you, but sadly, your own trust issues got in the way. You kept silencing me; cutting me off so quickly as I tried to connect with your kinky self.I never wanted your money, just your mind and body. I wanted the seduction to continue, but now, you have stopped believing in me. Now I have to stop believing in you and carry on with my life. Thank you for the few hopeful thoughts, but I need to cut the cord, my love. I loved you very much, but I love myself more.Farewell,XOp.s. I do still secretly hope you will deliver my missed connection to me, but out in the real world this time. xo"

You sat there in your pair of shorts and neon sunglasses staring out passed me into the sunset, just chillin'.. and looking oh-so-cute. :p Then you took a bit of a walk in the reeds behind the sand, snapped a few pics, had a smoke or a toke, wandered down the beach a bit back towards 6 & disappeared up the trail when I wasn't looking.. which means maybe you were a mirage, but I'm pretty sure you were a real boy & not Pinocchio.I was standing around sipping beers and having tokes with the locals, getting as much last minute sun on my back as possible, and not reeeeally missing that early sunset look because I had someone cute to watch a little farther back up the beach. :)I'd have wandered over and said hi, buuuut I didn't want to cut my convo short and be rude to the regulars, annnd we weren't that far over to the left side of the beach - sooo I couldn't be so sure you'd welcome any attention from another guy & didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable at all in such a chillin' spot of the world. I kind of sensed a bit of a gay vibe from you, but again wasn't too sure. That and even if you are gay, that doesn't mean I'm you're type, so that could be a little awkward.. all the more reason why I'm there for a toke & a tan and not a hookup - but damn did I ever enjoy my pre-sunset view of your cuteness relaxing so hard on the beach last night. 8)If this was you feel free to shoot me an email if you wanna chat & maybe hangout at the beach sometime?"

I'd kind of given up on actually seeing the smile of the seemingly confident, gesticulating man with the full volume laughter but when I turned to get my wallet to pay my bill and we made eye contact and smiled. Your smile was fantastic! So much so that I stayed for one more drink and thought I'd give you my number but ended up just leaving it at a smile shared when I realized I couldn't gauge how old you were and didn't want to interrupt you and your friends. In retrospect that seems pretty silly and I think I should have just said ""hey"" and introduced myself sooo here I am seeing if the fates allow for me to be a friendlier more forward version of myself.

You just made it all up in your head and yet u don't want people to think your crazy eh? That's a tough one. To see beauty you have to be beauty. Which is why you'll never get what you want. Because you believe that someone cannot possibly be as beautiful inside and out as me. You don't believe it's possible. I feel sorry for people like you. Jaded, cynical souls with too many skeletons in the closet who like to point fingers at innocent loving persons rather than sweeping up the dust bunnies in their own mind.

summer,Vancouver,m4w,Urgent! Contact me when you see this. I met you twice on No151/156 Bus - m4w,"Urgent! Contact me when you see this. I met you twice on No.151/156 BusNeed Help for a Missed Blessing Hi, I am an Asian looking guy and you are a very pretty caucasian girl. I first met you on No. 151/156 Bus about two years ago. We got on the bus at Lougheed Sky Train Station and the bus was going to Coquitlam Centre. You were sitting behind me with an Asian looking guy at that time. You and that Asian looking guy's conversation evoked my curiosity. So I turned around to take a look at you, but as soon as I see you, I was fully charmed by your temperament. After about one minute, I turned back. Then I could hear that Asian looking guy who was sitting besideyou was talking about me with you and laughing at me. So I thought maybe you were annoyed by my rudeness. After a few minute, I realized that I was about to get off from the bus soon, so I could not help to turn around to take the last look at you again in order to memorize you on my mind although maybe you were annoyed by my rudeness. Surprisingly, when I looked at you again, I found that you did not seem to be annoyed by my rudeness, instead, you looked at me, too and you smiled at me. Your two eyes and my two eyes kept contacting for about 30 minutes. Then the bus stopped at my stop. I was about to say something to you, but it was too late. After I just got off from the bus and the door on the bus was not closed yet, I could still see you looking at me and smiling at me... You had never slipped my mind since then. I hoped that I could see you again and talk to you when I see you again... After a few months, I heard your voice on the bus again, but because I was sitting at the back of the bus at that time, so I was not sure that was you sitting at the front of the bus. So I walked to the front of the bus to see whether that was you. As soon as I saw your face, I realized that was truly you. I wanted to say something to you or at least say a""hi"" to you, but the bus already stopped at my stop. After I got off from the bus, I took a look at the bus again and I found that you were still watching me through the window on the bus.Even though a long time has passed by, but I still remember you. You are like the holy and pure angel in my mind. How have you been? I hope everything is going well for you. Please forgive my rudeness when I first saw you and please forgive me for not even saying anything to you before I left. I think that was a truly blessing that God gave to me to let me meet you, but I missed the chances to talk to you and to get to know you better. As we know, one person will only have one chance to meet the person who he/she likes best. I guess I have already missed my chance. I went back to the bus stop at which we got on the bus before over and over again to hopefully meet you again, but no luck. I sincerely hope that you can see this and my photo and call me or email me.I graduated from McMaster University in Ontario, Canada and I came back to the Greater Vancouver Area in 2009. I met you after I came back to the Greater Vancouver Area. I hope everything is going well for you. All the best!"

summer,Vancouver,m4w,Unforgetful pain - m4w,"I know you and your ""real"" lover don't go on here or most importantly want to remember what you two did to me. I gave you everything and even though it was a lot of money that was the least of what still and what always hurt. You lied about a pregnancy, you lied about the ring you gave me from your dead dad. You lied about almost everything yet you didn't have the courage or guts to admit to me what you did. Two years I did everything for you and you gave me nothing but lies and heartbreak. Now I'm out of your life and you can pretend all you want that it never happened but it did and you can't deny that Sarah. You might be beautiful on the outside but your ugly and mad on the inside. Your beauty eventually will age and I will still have a heart of gold and the best intentions you now only dream about. So carry on smoking two packs a day and drinking your memories away. Best of all you showed me that no matter how good of a person I can be, it's sometimes impossible to find the love you desire. So I hope one day you will contact me and give me the proper apology I deserve after everything I did for you. But I really have my doubts you will ever have the intentions to do so. So enjoy all the cash you sucked out of me. I'm still hurt and bitter but I'm a better person because of it. So good luck with you and Maddie because once Murray is too old to shelter you girls from reality and your lies. You will be doomed and I don't need to do anything because I am not a part of your train wreck that's coming soon. You will never find a more caring loving person then I was but I hope you and Maddie are happy from what you two did. So cheers to two years and six digit figures of money I wasted on you both... I'm a free man now and hopefully one day I can forget you, it's been hard...very hard because I loved you I really did. You know I did Sarah. But now I wish we never met. GoodbyeJK"

I met you when you worked at Earles about a million years ago.

I ran into you once and we briefly talked while walking down (I think it was) Georgia St. You told me you'd been in Japan. The last time I saw you was at a party at Spanish Banks years ago. A short distance from the bustle, I wandered down to the water and was completely captivated by a beautiful woman standing out on the rocks in the water as the sun was slowly rising above her with the city in the background. Only as you passed me did I realize it was you again. I know you recognized me but we didn't speak. I know with all this information, there is only one person that would identify with all these scenarios. I find it inconceivable that all these scenarios have been just happenstance.

You looked at my phone while I was changing songs and asked me if I could listen to music on my phone. I said yes, I asked you what you listened to, and then I asked you if you liked Eric Clapton. Your face lit up and you told me that you did. Then I asked you if you liked Layla (the song I was listening to), and you started playing air guitar and singing layla right there on the platform! I had a Perma smile on my face because of you for an hour, and I still can't stop thinking about it and smiling when I do.

I tried and can't insert a link, so search Youtube for Townes and the song Columbine.BTW, I kinda have a good reason for chickening out on the whole talking with you thing, beyond the fact I was (and am) floored by your beauty and presence.

A block later, however, I was kicking myself for not stopping to talk to you a little longer.It was really kind of you to stop and see if I was OK.

Thank you to those who emailed me to tell me how to reach a VPD officer's voicemail.   Hope you enjoyed the posting as much as I did!    J*****************************************************************************You gave me a violation ticket for passing on the right May 24.  I was driving a grey Honda CRV and heading west on Grandview (trying to make a right (north) on Renfrew).  I have learnt my lesson and realize that ""it is really dangerous"" to pass on the right and now I am so remorseful that I want to make up for the error of my ways and ask you out (insert smiley face here).I didn't want to interfere with your job and professional duties but when you asked me if I had any questions, my mind filled up with a myriad of questions like:   Are you single? Are you dating?  Would you go on a date with me? Would it be too forward to ask you? Is this inappropriate? etc.Eventually, I did settle on a non-committal question like ""do you get asked out much?""   I really loved the look on your face when you said ""not lately"".   I replied, ""oh, you really should ....  because you have such nice eyes!""  I have to admit that I chickened out and now I'm kicking myself for not asking you out.  I was thinking about contesting the Violation ticket (ending in 9982) so you would show up and I'd have the opportunity to ask you then but I don't want to tax the court system more than it is presently so this is the only other way I conceived that might possibly work.   In the event that you see this, please email me back to let me know if you're single.

summer,Vancouver,m4w,re in need of advice - m4w,"So the first thing is that any man that is with a woman for a year is commited. The fact that there is past issues with both of you is another biggie.  It means both of you are seeing one another through the eyes of the pain and anger.  If you haven't left, may I ask is there any abuse??? as for wasting energy on what you say you are, then spend your energy building a loving and lasting relationship.  a man that has your back thrugh thick and thin is rare.  and NO man will ever put himself last if all he is thinking about is himself.  No matter what the world says, thinks, or does always remember that you two are the ones toghether.  and be sure to REALLY question who you take advice, if it is family what do they have to gain if the relationship fails or succeeds? do they always do whats right for you? NOTHING IN LIFE THAT IS WORTH HAVING IS EASY.  FALLING IN LOVE IS EASY. STAYING IN LOVE IS WORK THAT LASTS A LIFE TIME. NEVER RUN FROM LOVE BECAUSE IT IS TO HARD. AND BE READY TO GIVE IN SOME GROUND FROM TIME TO TIME.  LOVE IS NOT ABOUT WINS OR LOSSES. RIGHT OR WRONG. IT IS ABOUT MAKING YOURSELF HAPPY THOUGH MAKING YOUR PARTNER HAPPY.  ITS FUNNY BUT WHEN I SEE THE SMILE ON MY GUSY FACE WHEN I DO THE SMALLEST THINGS. I KNOW HE LOVES ME. In closing, let say that if it has been under a year you two have been together then you are still getting to know eachother, and no matter how small the reason for you staying build on it."

Or is he lying because you are constantly questioning everything he does?How sure are you he has your back when it seems like you can barely trust the guy, evident from your constantly questioning?1) Its not really everything is it? You want his focus and attention...but its elsewhere.2) Not sure if there is an easier way, but disbelief and resentment has never healed anyone.3) Perhaps...a different kind of happiness.

She had to come find me on several occasions because every time she looked up you were gawking at her. We also witnessed you doing this to others. One woman we talked to said she too tried to escape you yet every time she looked up there you were. How you were able to find a woman who puts up with that is beyond us. I know this is a long shot you will see this but I had to put it out there. Why don't you take care of what you have instead of trying to pick up on other woman."

What is wrong with me or is this normal? We are both beat down. Broken and used, abused yet he is the only one who without any question always has my back. 1) would a man give you everything you ever needed, even if it meant he went without , if you weren't the only one he were focused on?2) is there an easier way to heal than torturing each other with constant disbelief and feelings of being used?3) is there happiness after heartbreak with the same partner?

At least I meant well by my message unlike yours which are full of hate. How dare you talk about vulnerable populations that way. I feel sorry for you. Remind everyone never to come to you to diffuse a situation. You're in a lot of trouble. You're the one crying out for help. Why don't you do the math?And as for my tight pussy, well I'm' sorry I shared that with the wrong man. I won't make that mistake a second time. That I can promise you. I'm comfortable in my own skin.

summer,Vancouver,m4w,RE: Butch - m4w,"Hey Butch, God I'm such a fucking moron! Thank you so much for getting in touch with me. It meant a lot to me. When issues come up, I know that it's 50/50 equal in responsibility. And that the only person we can control is ourselves. So I'm working on myself right now and want to take back that ugly condescending message I wrote before where I'm holding a grudge (for months) and still blaming you. Thank you for sharing with me your most vulnerable thoughts. It took alot of courage to share that with me. And it showed me that you can trust me enough to share those challenges that you've had in the past. You are an amazing person for overcoming so much. And I want to do everything I can to continue to support you in making positive changes for the future. Rather than making you apologize to me, I'm the one who should be apologizing. I hold grudges and blame others because I'm a pretty boy whose used to getting by on my looks so I've never really had to learn how to reach further and try in romantic relationships. I've treated them like the soccer field - it's kill or be killed. I leave it all up to the other person and share nothing of myself, never really putting myself out there and being vulnerable. That way if they do something wrong, I can blame them and exonerate myself from any responsibility. I've been brainwashed into believing these tactics will work. But I'm slowly learning that all of nothing, perfection and blaming don't make good compromising tools in my box of love. Recently, I had a friend call me out on my bullshit because she knows I'm not listening and/or trying (at all) with anyone. In the past I wanted to be ""the man"" and also be wooed and chased like ""the woman"". So basically there's no room for you in my narcissistic head because I'm hogging both roles. Talk about clueless. And really, you getting in touch with me directly, and my responding indirectly by posting on craigslist is total bullshit communication and makes this issue now 80/20 in your favour (and not mine). I'll call you later tonight. I'm turning over a new leaf of honesty and effort. I might even stop by Chapters to pick up a book to help guide me to greater heights of relationship know-how. God knows I need the help. J"

I am happy that we met (at a very specific school several years ago). NO it's not an elementary secondary or college/university. So it's probably not you.  At times I missed you until recently. I was able to email you on Facebook and tell you something specific. I knew you wouldn't reply. I'm glad you didn't reply.  I'm finally at a very good place in my life; I've accomplished so much since you left without a word.  Understandable.  The end of our relationship killed me, literally.

I wasn't sure where to post this, as.... this is strictly platonic, yet it is/was a missed connection......)I know that you both will probably never read this, but I deeply do appreciate the very deep conversation that we've had.

Not sure why because I live alone but too worried about having someone random come to my house.You also sid that guys there do not seem to be attracted to you and you end up just being content witth actually using Steam1 for what it is actually intended for.You have no idea what most guys are saying about you and drool when you walk by.I wanted to tell you very badly that you are exactly the type of person who I want.We chatted for almost 45 minutes and while I noticed you looking me up and down,looking directly into my eyes with your sexy eyes,giving me that ""come get me"" look but I was too stupid to do so even though I wanted to more than anything.You said you had to go because you were there for 2 hours but I know it was less than that because I had been there about an hour before you were.I tried to write down my number and email address but by the time I did and came out of my room,you had left.True to your word,you left without hookingup with anyone but seemed content nonetheless and so did I.I can't get you out of my mind and regret not being able to connect with you or at least give you my contact info.I should have asked you out for a coffee or something but the truth is you were extremely stunning and I was completely intimidated by you cosidering I am an average guy and you are anything but.I can't stop thinking about your amazing body,you are built fem and I love that.I am Bi,I am a strict top and yes, I understand what GID is and am more than okay with someone who has it.I'm also ""not the usual type of person who goes to Steam1"" either.I know I am your type and thre is no doubt you are mine,so if you happen to read this,PLEASE,PLEASE reply to this.I know it's a long shot but I can only hope."

summer,Vancouver,m4m,"Dylan, Langara College, Business, UBC - m4m","I am looking for someone who took some business courses at Langara College in the fall semester of 2013. You studied at Langara only for that semester. After that semester was over, I did not see you anymore since, disappearing without trace. The last moment we saw each other was when you were smoking with your classmates in front of the building B overlooking the library, I rushed fast into the class because my professor just got in to the class. I think it was the third week of December of that year. Even if month by month has passed, I still cannot forget you. I kept trying to find you here and there, but it still does not yet produce any successful result.Right now I study at UBC. If you are at UBC and by chance you noticed me, please come closer and I will say hi (but I am naturally shy). If I can know you, it will contribute a lot to my life - even if we cannot be close. Actually I wanted to go to school in Toronto/Montreal because I have medical problems where over there I can find doctors who can help me with my problems, but I decided not to do it because I thought by staying here and going to UBC, the chance of finding you will become a reality one day. One day of that semester, I kind of heard someone called you Dylan or Deland, but it could be wrong because of the strong noise and distance. You have brown hair and an oval face, are of medium height, and are very talkative. I think you took Introduction to Marketing (MARK 1115) course taught at room 148. The course could be wrong, but you did have a class in that room. I saw you entering that room after you got out of the washroom. I really regret to have not said anything to you when the opportunity was abundantly available - and I am really suffering because of that. Please Dylan, if you happen to notice me some place, please approach me because your presence (knowing you) in my life is a strength for me, thus making me able to go on. Or maybe people out there who are familiar with somebody named Dylan and fit the description that I described above, please let him know, and if you want me to reciprocate please email me.  Thanks"

Sometimes I think you feel the attraction too  at-least I hope anyways. I never know if you are flirting back or just being very nice. Timing is wrong and nothing will probably ever happen between us.

Then we got another guy who appears to be writing rap verses with a technical efficiency comparable to Charles Barkley's golf swing.You guys are seriously a lot of fun. My life fuckin sucks right now, but you guys actually give me something to look forward to everyday, and make me chuckle. Thanks!"

summer,Vancouver,m4m,Did you leave me (Matt) a voicemail msg on May 13 re: Hep C? - m4m,"Hey y'all. I recently checked my phone's voicemail and heard a message from a former one-night stand telling me about a Hep C diagnosis, roughly transcribed below:""Um, Matt? I don't wanna tell you this, but we met up off Craigslist a couple days* ago and you gave me your number** and I just found out at the doctor that I have Hep C*** and I lied to you and I'm just really sorry and [unintelligible; sobbing starts] and I wanna know if you're okay. Can you just, can you just talk to me [?], this is Kyle [?]. Um, I'll give you my number and you can call and (unintelligible) and lemmie know just to check in [?]. Give me a call back [unintelligible]. Sorry, 'k bye.""* - ""we met off Craigslist a couple days ago"" except I haven't been on Craigslist since November 2014.** - ""you gave me your number"" when leaving this message, the mystery person called ***-***-1876.*** - except because Hep C is primarily spread through blood-blood contact; it's unlikely you can get Hep C through sexual intercourse alone, so...Looking through my call logs, this message was sent on May 13th at 5:00 am on a hidden/unknown number. I'm really confused at who this person is because they told me to call them, but never left a number and actually hid their number when they tried to call me. What's even more confusing is that despite the message saying ""we met up off Craigslist a couple days ago"", I actually haven't been on Craigslist in 7 months (and Grindr in 2 months).I heard the name ""Kyle"", so I went through my phone to find only one saved contact named Kyle. I texted him about it but he informed me he's clean (tested a month ago) and said we only met up once in October.Despite all the discrepancies in the message, I still wanna know who this person is. If one of my former partners contracted a disease after being with me, even if it's unlikely that disease was spread through sex, it still concerns me and I need to know. Whoever you are, please reach out to me so we can discuss this.Matt"

I know a little about you, but not enough.  You are still somewhat of a mystery.We have a psychic connection that I don't think can be denied.  Being so close to you, I often feel what I think is your energy and your thoughts pouring out to me.  When I see you, I don't just see you, I feel you.I want to believe that what we could have would be so strong a bond, and such a rewarding relationship that we would truly have found our soulmates.Other times I wonder if this is a figment of my imagination and wishful thinking.I'm far from perfect, and I have some bad habits.I am scared to start over, with you, or alone.I'm also scared to be away from you, and loose whatever this something is.

summer,Toronto,w4m,RE: RE: I know you watch me - w4m,"I AM interested in finding the guy -- don't you judge me!I met him a few months ago, however it is possible that we first met about 3 years ago now. I was smoking a cigarette where I should not have been, he intended to ticket me. Although I'm unsure of whether his intention was to talk to me or that he was in fact going to ticket me, either way he was caught in my eyes and he said that I have beautiful brown eyes...I was scared because I was young and just starting to smoke 420, and I had just picked up a big bag right before he stopped me for smoking. So needless to say I was scared shit less that he would smell it in my bag and search me so I didn't really think of him flirting with me since all that ran through my mind was ""oh shit, oh shit, oh shit..."".Now that I'm older and also more knowledgeable about law, I understand that he couldnt have searched me for smoking a cigarette on TTC property. I work at night now bartending and there have been instances in the past where I'm alone in the abyss of night and I see one lone ranger yonder along the distance, almost as if ensuring my safe journey home... and I think of him. Because of the nature of his work, and my information being easily attainable for him, I feel he might be the one. Or maybe its just wishful thinking, either way I want to find out because if what I think is the case itd be soooo sweet. If not then it could be some other jack ass that I have no interest in. This is the only instance where someone watching me would be romantic lol.. anybody else watching needs to fuck off."

Now, you think that you can make this actually happen.... I am obviously irrelevant in the picture, so why even bother? Why try and clue into things that play no role in your life?

I am the black guy who was wearing a hat, glasses, and I have facial hair. Tell me my name, and what I was wearing in your first email. Let's talk again, and see what happens."

You always want to meet at night to avoid being seen, usually in a park or a parking lot.   We chat for a bit but the holding, kissing and cuddling under the cover of darkness quickly progresses.  I slide my hands up the back of your shirt while holding you so I can feel even closer to you.  We frantically start unbuttoning and unzipping each other to relieve each other's stresses of the day.  Once we finish you always tell me that you must be getting back to reality. We give each other a passionate kiss and embrace before you drive off to your regular home life.  We both feel an excitement and anticipation for our next meet. You...are not real, but that is a really hot scenario."

You had dark brown hair and very prominent eyelashes, and you were bumping tunes on your iPhone. You kept looking at me, and it almost seemed to me like you were coming from pride or some sort of event, perhaps you were going to one.The subway came to a slow, and you bumped into the person behind you, shyly you looked at me, and smiled and whispered ""oops"" with the most gorgeous smile.You then took out a purple see through bottle with a jeweled strap and began to drink water while you were taking in my glances and smiles.  As I got out of Lawrence, I turned around and saw you smile at me, and was hoping you were getting off too.This is a ridiculous longshot, but I am that boy with the white toque, and white spacers, jean jacket, blue chucks and an over-bearingly heavy backpack wanting to get in contact with you.If anyone knows who this girl may be, please let me know.

summer,Toronto,m4m,Brown Guy at the Gym - m4m,"I see you at the gym often, always in the afternoon. You wear a sleeveless hoodie, gym pants, and your headphones. Out of all the guys at the gym, your physique is the one I admire the most. Your arms are incredibly big, and well defined - as is the rest of your body. You chest is huge, bulging at the fabric of your hoodie, and so well rounded. I am envious of the progress you've made, but it is clear that you have worked hard for it. A couple of times I found myself walking into the locker room after a workout, to find you standing at your locker completely naked. It's so refreshing to see a straight man who is not ashamed to show off his body, or afraid that gay men would ""check them out"" as every straight man seems to think. Your butt is perfectly round and just a tad lighter shade of your dark olive complexion. I've tried a few times, with no luck, to catch a glimpse of your penis, but I am sure it is magnificent. I have fantasized about the possibility of kneeling behind you while you are standing at your locker, and spreading your perfectly shaped butt-cheeks, catching a waft of your sweaty manly scent after a long workout. I wonder what it would taste like to bring my tongue to your tight hole and slowly caress it, licking around the hole. I picture you submitting in pleasure, grasping at the lockers in ecstasy. I wonder what it would be like if you were to turn around, and face me with your thick, juicy, uncut (I presume) cock. The hot precum and foreskin emitting such an arousing musk. I would take it in one hand, pull back the foreskin and take your giant cock in my mouth. I'd work the shaft as I suck on the tip, slipping my hand in between your muscular legs and playing with your hole, still wet from my spit. Do you have any idea how good it feels to have a finger slide into your hole while having your cock sucked? I imagine your legs would be shaking with pleasure at this point, and you sit down, while i continue to suck on your manhood, caressing your muscularly sculpted upper body, and running my fingers on your inner thighs. If you were to cum - loudly - I'd take it all in my mouth, swallowing every last drop of your man-juice, as if it could magically give me a tenth of the body you have. I get up to leave, you nod out of breath, and chuck your sweaty, wet, musky underwear at me. I take a sniff where your huge cock and balls would have been, wink at you, and leave. Only if..."
summer,Toronto,m4w,A streetcar named desire... - m4w,"We both rode in the middle of the double-car this morning on our way downtown. You looked absolutely amazingly stunning and I really should have told you so. Because that would be a little out of character for me (though I probably come off pretty aloof - it's a defensive mechanism); that I would have hated to creep you out in any way. I stood there, half-singing to myself, half wanting to serenade you right then & there at the top of my lungs. In this nicer weather I've been trying to avoid the TTC as much as possible but I'm really grateful I didn't this morning; to catch a glimpse of something so inspiring and beautiful IS beautiful.. Thanks for that, pretty girl."

I yearn for you, I long to be held in your arms.We are both lost souls, but together we have found one another. We will never be lost in each other's arms...

I've always hinted at the fact that you are, indeed, the object of my affection. You did as well, but it does pain me to say that nothing will go beyond our interactions. We both know the consequences if we ever went beyond just talking to each other. The whole point of this post was to just clear my head because I can never repeat this to anyone that I know. Anonymous is the best way for this. I love you."

summer,Toronto,m4w,"F____a, at Starbucks - m4w","I strongly hesitated about posting this, mainly because you seem so much younger than me. You're likely 2nd or 3rd year University, and I'm 26. Compound that with the fact that I'm a taken man, and it's a serious recipe for trouble.However, I come into your work every weekday morning between 7:30 and 8:30 AM for a drink on my way to work. I come in after work, as well, from time to time and sometimes see you there.I'd be lying if I said that I came in only because I'm addicted to caffeine. The sad truth is that I have an astonishingly beautiful woman at home, who is the most lazy person I 've ever met. I have to look after her (clean her dishes, do her laundry, pay the bills, clean up after her, wait on her) the same way a parent does, and you're the breath of fresh air that makes my day worth while. I still care greatly for my girlfriend, and I don't want to break up with her because I feel like she needs someone to slowly wake her up to reality, but the truth is that I'd give anything to date someone that seems half as bubbly, funny, cute, and responsible as you.I'll keep coming by, but I likely won't say anything, or ever make a move.I just wanted you to know that you're admired and you make someones day, every day."

summer,Toronto,w4m,The notorious Chinese wall - w4m,"You, ruler of my soul, have toyed with a metaphysical concept involving active experimentation:* Visually: narrating entire stories, in theory, conceptually, with serenity; however, you don't believe in any of it. It's like Ebenezer Scrooge being visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past only to wake up - alone - in your unlit room, realizing that all you want to do is get out and away from the tormenting darkness that has descended upon the city.* Physically: taking advantage of experience or lack thereof, searching for habitual patters to engage yourself in an emotionally satisfying bond that does not always extend beyond the surface of the skin. You test for compatibility and try to correlate infatuated fantasies with kinesthetic realities. Knowledge of schedule is of the utmost importance because that allows you to be in control rather than feeling rejected and insecure.* Auditory: you spread gossip amongst your friends, most being quite untrue and a grotesque exaggeration that you fabricated in your own mind. You've convinced yourself that people will believe you because you are sure that you are not schizophrenic and have a reputation to preserve. You insist that you know the truth, but when was the last time you acquired physical evidence for your accusations?You are on the other side of the Chinese wall, and only you can decide that this is only a mainstream psychological concept instilled into us by the rejection of supernatural concepts that are seen as nothing more than mere fictional manifestations in a cold and harsh world where pragmatism always produces sound results over idealism."
summer,Toronto,w4m,PB I Miss You Too Much - w4m,"I never should have let you go. I hope you know that I'll regret letting you out of my life forever. Friends don't make-out and screw, but we always do, but when it comes to being in a relationship you said you'd never go down that route again. It's too bad. We were great together for the whole eight years. I guess when we're dead and in heaven we'll meet again. I feel like no matter who we end up with we're the ones who are destined to be together. I used to have spaces in my heart for other people but now that you're gone, you've filled up those crevices as well. It's like the loneliness and heart break was the only thing missing from our relationship and now that I have it I realized that you're perfect. The only one for me. I'm sorry I messed things up. You'll probably never read this but I had to send it out. I miss you a lot."

summer,Toronto,m4w,Blonde in denim jacket with white converse at Tim Hortons - m4w,"Hey, I really doubt that this will lead me to you, but it's probably the only thing I can do and I'm trying. It was earlier tonight (late Saturday night or early Sunday morning) around 3ish am after most party people finished the night and about to head home. I walked out from Tim Horton's at King and Bathurst, saw you sitting alone outside grabbing a bite, and noticed how your outfit was on point. From what I remembered, you were in a denim jacket, probably grey cotton dress(?), and a pair of white converse. You are a gorgeous blonde white girl and beautiful skin tone with tan. I wasn't so sure because it was dark and I couldn't really stare at you out of my shyness. So I walked past you and sat down on the other side of stairs, and seconds later walked past you again to enter Tim Horton's to grab some napkins because my XL coffee spilled lol. I came back to where I was sitting and smoked a cigarette. Sorry if the smoke got you while you were eating, I hope you didn't mind. I'm the tall and slim Asian guy with black hair and glasses, also with my white ear buds on. Denim shirt and dark charcoal pants with a pair of white sneakers. I fell like there were a few subtle glances exchanged and maybe some connections between us. I was too shy to walk up to you and initiate a conversion. I regretted not talking to you so much as soon as I eyed you crossed the street and hopped on a cab in front of a condo. If it was my misunderstanding, never mind. But if you did notice me and felt the same way as I did, please get back to me. I'd totally love to see you again and perhaps grab a coffee with you anytime!! Sorry in advance for my lengthy message, as it's my first time and I'm aware that chances are so slim... anyways, I hope a miracle does indeed exist. Cheers"

summer,Toronto,w4m,Guy on GOtrain to Union who liked my spacers/showed me to the elevator - w4m,"Bit of a long shot, but I've been kicking myself about this. You caught me right before I left the train and we talked about our spaced ears for a bit. You showed me to the elevator, got on the same subway as me, and off at the same stop. Chatted a bit, smiled more, but I wasn't sure if you were just being nice or flirting with me! When you got off the subway, you opted to exit through the same doors as me. I thought you were behind me and intended on asking for your number, but I didn't see you anymore. Siiggghhhh. But yeah, I have a bunch of tattoos, some piercings and short black hair, and was wearing my glasses most of the time we spoke."

What's wrong with you?-I'm not special. And if you like me then you are not special. So we will end up getting married, maybe kids, probably no house, and then you will divorce me for a guy who can give you better. I am ready for that. Just say when."

summer,Toronto,w4m,Chuck - I don't - w4m,"It's been over fifteen years since I first laid eyes and you and I used to think that you were the singular purpose of my life - at one point - as the central pillar of exemplary standards and a voluntary role model for those who have striven to achieve the impossible.Chuck, life has come and gone for me, but we are forever set apart on opposite sides of a resonating bridge that threatens to be torn into shreds with every year that passes. We never dared to cross over to the other side because somewhere deep inside we both had faith in the ""normal"".I too have chosen... I've chosen to be your friend... and it will be in this normality that we can really find our purpose without external expectations. If it happens.... then, according to you, that's God making it happen - not you. You've lost her now, and very soon, you will lose me too. It's been a beautiful story but your absence has lingered on my mind for a while and I am sure that you will be the sweet, humble, arrogant, egomaniac that you've always been. You will not see this but I just want to put it here should one of your friends tip you off again - like the good ol' days.P.S.  - the next time we have an unexpected encounter, I will most likely be a mother. Perhaps another decade without you will allow me to appreciate the man you plan on becoming. xoxo"

summer,Toronto,m4w,The proudest moment in my life - m4w,"What is it which attracts us to the energy of another individual? Does love make sense? How do two people know they are for one another?  How do you know when you have come across someone? Does your body stop producing drugs which attracts others? Do we just stay in love with someone to be? Why is it that it felt like we knew each other for decades? Is that how love feels? See I use to be a player andAll of this is new to meAnd this ain't what I'm used to seeBecause I never been in love beforeMaybe love is just a frequency two individuals can share, and others cannot see? I think we have that shared frequency but we were just afraid to broadcast on the same channel. You were the definition of proper on the outside and I was disaster but I could see that we were both hiding who we were.... was when I didn't ask you out because it finally made me look at my life and what I want. See I want you. I need you. You seemed to powerful. So strong, yet weak. If I fix my shit -- I will get at you and if you think our frequencies were matching then maybe you will get at me... but remember... the day you end up with me -- means you are settling for a frequency which won't broadcast on any popular channel."

At one point you were right beside me and I wanted to roll down my window and touch your hand that was sticking out. But as you saw I couldn't, I was having an intense conversation and I wanted to say hi so badly. I would love to connect, I will explain everything if you reply.Like I said this is a long shot that you're ever reading this, but I have to take a chance, because I can't get that smile out of my mind.

summer,Toronto,w4m,my Emperor - w4m,"during my walk this morning, i thought about you, and what i'd like to know. and whether you too have speculated that we're all just trying to return to that primal state before our being was formed. my god, when you think of the incredible events leading up to conception. the arousal and longing - so intense, exquisite. the first embrace and kiss - electric, the hint and promise of that merging so desired. clothes off, our naked selves revealed, vulnerable yet trusting. your reaching, straining erection - my god, i make myself wet just thinking of it. the penetration, the swelling and throbbing, held within so deep, our bodies and minds one. the strength and virility of your orgasm, from which a hundred-thousand sperm madly race to reach one egg. of ALL those sperm, only one. and that one made you. we came from that. we come for more. it really is, as some have said, a miracle.an exquisite, mind-blowing thing, this LIFE. what is it that truly rules us?"

Next to you was a black bike helmet.I was walking by with a coworker just coming back from a trip to McDonald's. I was the tall Asian girl in heels.I noticed you. You noticed me. We exchanged glances. I was hoping you would say hi but I guess it would've been awkward for the both of us. After we walked by, my coworker thought he dropped something and as we checked the ground, I glanced back at you and pleasantly caught your stare.Hoping this will catch your eye or that I'll see you at that Tim Horton's again."

summer,Toronto,m4m,I miss you - m4m,"JThe first day I met you, you claimed my heart.  After many years, we met again on grindr.   You realized I have always been in love with you.  Due to certain circumstances you said unless that's taken care of, nothing can happen between us.  I didn't want to hurt anyone, so i chose not to do anything. After a while I blocked you because it was so painful to look at your pic but can't hug you.  I am sorry.  After I unblock everyone, i tried to talk to you but you ignored me.  I know I can only blame myself for it.Anyways i know you probably hate me.   I just want you to know that you have and will always be my crush...   P.S.  You still haven't checked out my place.."
summer,Toronto,m4w,What day is it today? - m4w,"Today,Is a day of despair. Regret. Not something that sounds like the man you dreamed of. I wake up without you - wondering what I've done wrong. Helpless. Hopeless. Flooded with the toxic feelings of inaction. Paralysis. Nothing fun. But was a magic answer necessary? What could I be waiting for when I felt your love for me. & mine for you.If you don't wait, I have not given up. I'm stuck. Lost.If you did wait, I am trying to find you. Every day.If you are waiting, I am too. I want you.I am waiting. Why? I wanted this always. I wait because I dread the thought of me consciously making a step towards never seeing you again. & then I serendipitously come across you, and nothing. I do not hold you like I should. I do not say hi. Why do I torture myself this way. It makes me lonely. Alone. This is not the side anyone should see. I am at odds with myself. Why would anyone love me like this.Love. I had so much to give. But I missed out. The world stops listening. People stop. Maybe it's my illusion that ends. Of a different (greater) life. So self-centric. I don't enjoy it. I was never one for the emptiness inside. Is this common? Am I just like everybody else?We all want a pass when we are insecure. We want to belong when we feel like we don't. This is not a good feeling.What do I stand for? Not this. A state of mind that is not conducive to one's well being. I need to grow. Flourish. I need to wake up. You did not give me the opportunity so I could let you down. Wake up. Wake. up.Life will not always be perfect, but I need to realize something greater. Above me. Above myself, when I feel like this. There is more. We all want the same things inside. Don't let it pass. The end was a new beginning. It is not too late. The world needs to know how much I love you. You need to know. It's not fair to you to make you wait. I always wanted it too. With you.I need to get simple. Down to the basics. Shut down this mind, and slow down. Rebuild. For the future holds imagination. Wonder. Dreams of love that have been felt before. You're amazing and I don't want to let that go. I need to move forward with a better life. Slow down the mind. What if the gut was right. Where is my instinct. My physicality. The rest of me that makes men great. I cannot figure it all out with a mind. You did not fall in love with one, solely for itself - when it was perhaps left with only poison remaining.   There is more to me. A step towards living is not a step towards letting go of you. Growing is still possible. The universe will know, where to send me when my feelings for you were so pure. I miss you. I want you. The rest of me will be simple, for a while. I will be naive, if that is what it takes. Foolishly hoping for you in the simplest of terms. My mind needs rest. This connection to you is not something I can let go. I will start from the simplest terms. Back to the basics. No need to complicate it all and get lost in my mind. I always wanted more.You showed me the potential of more. With you."
summer,Toronto,m4m,Blue Shirt Guy at Fly Night Club - m4m,"We were at the Asian dance night at Fly on Friday June 19. We were checking each other out a lot on the dance floor.

It sits in my mind like a cancer that cannot be eradicated. You remain so near but so far. The odd pass by, the odd reference and the odd mention of your name is all we have left. You said it was a mistake... It was fate. And nothing you will ever have will be as special and as caring. I want you...to be well. Content. Happy. Next time you stroll out of Sobeys say hi... Pretend it mattered."

summer,Toronto,w4m,"Farewell to thee, craigslist - w4m","Oh craigslist, such a sweet beginning we had! You seduced me with your promises. You purred so gently into my eager ear....and gave me shivers as I believed that you would find my missed connection all of those years ago. On that first blissful meeting, we spent so many hours together: me discovering you, and you unleashing my own kinks. It was then when I fell for you - such hope and sweet and filthy kindred spirits! Oh my!!I scrolled through the endless needs and wants you shared, as you tickled my fingertips with saucy desires. Yes, oh my god yes, I wanted more!! I put myself on full display for you....sharing my own kinky self....offering my entire being to you, my delicious partner in crime. I wanted all of my self to be seen. So wonderfully titillating! I closed my eyes and jumped in to you with my oversexed self.And the flood began...the dam was broken and there was no turning back. I wanted to feel you on me, in me as I was ready to open those scintillating notes from you. The first few felt like an awkward first encounter, but I persevered. Sometimes it felt like you were mocking my desire, but how could you? Look at all those promises you made to me with your words, paragraphs and pictures....so many pictures. You overwhelm me! A plethora of unexpected anatomy and physiology lessons!There is much I have learned from you, my dear.Your teasing was endless, and you never gave me a chance to share my authentic self with you. There were some very sensual and loving offerings I tried to make to you, but sadly, your own trust issues got in the way. You kept silencing me; cutting me off so quickly as I tried to connect with your kinky self. I never wanted your money, just your mind and body. I wanted the seduction to continue, but now, you have stopped believing in me. Now I have to stop believing in you and carry on with my life. Thank you for the few hopeful thoughts, but I need to cut the cord, my love. I loved you very much, but I love myself more.Farewell,XOp.s. I do still secretly hope you will deliver my missed connection to me, but out in the real world this time. xo"

Maybe you really do want to spend the rest of your life with me.You've gotten good at this, sometimes I even wonder if you believe your own lies. I've gotten good at this too, this game of pretending and acting as if I dont know the truth.This is not that type of missed connection, I see you everyday.Its a missed connection between our hearts and motives; I missed the signs, the facts, the imperfections before I let you take my heart. Its a missed connection between my logic and my emotions, between what I feel and what you SAY you feel.You dont know I'm posting this for you because you would not expect me to post here.

summer,Toronto,m4w,420 friendly and more - m4w,"What's up ladies , Would you like to meet up and smoke some 420 or maybe snow if you are interested. We can party and enjoy like the rock star."
summer,Toronto,m4w,you left me when I needed you the most... - m4w,"I'm secretly hoping 'you' will stumble upon this because I know you're always reading these late at night.So here it goes:I'm at the lowest I've ever been.......I find out you are seeing someone else behind my back, cheating,  and then you dump me a few days later...one blow after the other, but latter being the knockout. I thought you would be here to support me and help me and love me after you told me you were seeing someone...but just as I was  entering the beginning stages of recovery, you decide to leave me. you promised you'd be with me forever and always, you looked in my eyes and promised me, you reassured me that you'd do nothing to break my heart. When you told me you were seeing someone else behind my back, I forgave you on the spot. You know how badly I hate when other guys get near you, and when you told me what you had done, it took every bit of me to forgive you. Yet, you played me at the end, you just stabbed me in the heart for forgiving you by leaving me. I never thought something so hurtful would happen to me especially from someone that I trusted my life with.  I'm still really hurt and broken from you seeing someone else and I'm trying to forget it happened, yet at the same time I'm trying to cope with you leaving me because I don't 'excite' you...I gave you my heart and you let it fall deeper, and deeper, and deeper ...and as you know, this was something I always felt in my nightmares and you'd always comfort me and tell me you'd be here for me always. I wish I had someone to talk to about my feelings, I wish there was someone to hear me and to hear my point of view about the things I felt...but I'm stubborn like that, I don't disclose anything about us to anyone, even now I won't. I have always felt that whatever happens inside a relationship should be kept inside, out of respect.Right now, I don't have anyone else, you were the only one who knew me. I didn't even know myself before you. You were the one I waited for my whole life, I dreamt of you all the time. however, despite you leaving me, I still feel that we are meant to be because you were the one who would show up in my dreams when I'd lay down on the field at my school and look up at the clouds; you are the exact image of the one I would see in dreams. That hope is the only thing keeping me together right now...other than that hope, I have nothing else. Knowing you'll see other people makes me feel bitter, betrayed, and beaten. Bitter because you will be not with me anymore, you'll be spending time with other guys. betrayed because I knew you were seeing people while we were together but you always made me feel crazy and insecure for feeling that. and now, I know you will go back to that person you were seeing. I know you saw him today when you decided to leave me. and lastly, I feel beaten because I couldn't make you happy, I couldn't make you love me, I couldn't make you look at me with joy the way I do...someone else will do that now...I tried so hard to make you happy and to feel loved, yet that wasn't the problem for you, it was because I 'didn't talk enough' and I 'didn't excite' you... I wish I had something to show for my love like a house or a car or a ring...maybe that would've changed your mind about me. Maybe if I still wasn't in school, you'd feel different about me. Maybe if we could travel the world together, you'd feel different about me. and maybe if I did 'talk enough' you'd still be with me. I wish I could be all those things that you saw missing in me, I wish I could keep you forever.. Life works in mysterious ways or at least the 'man up stairs' makes life work in mysterious way because just as all of this is happening to me, I have to take my father to the hospital for yet another emergency visit. Maybe it's a sign that nothing will go my way? Maybe I'm just that unlucky? Maybe this is my destiny? Who knows...At the end of the day, I hope you will always remember how much I care and love you. and that I will always be here if you ever decide to come back. yes, you said it's not a dignified thing to do, but I don't want to be with anyone else nor do I see my self with anyone else. I have promised you that since day 1 and I hope you remember it...lastly, I hope you remember me.Sincerely,the guy who loved too much"

The way you hold yourself, how confident you are, and how your stare at me can lock the best of them's hearts. I was too shy to imply anything to you because of how handsome you are. Really. I've never been attracted to Asians, but you're just so good looking. I also never try to connect with boys in this desperate way, but I'm leaving it up to the stars that we find each other again. All I can think about is you now Allan. Let's see if you read this........"

I waited for you to quit and then added you to Facebook and LinkedIn and Instagram.All my requests were rejected. I really thought you loved me.Such an idiot I am.... maybe the third time is the charm."

summer,Toronto,m4w,food basics cashier - m4w,To the gorgeous cashier who works at food basics i would love the chance to take you out. You have caught me looking at you a few times now and i have caught you looking at me aswell you know who you are. I dont come in there to often although lately i find myself coming in a lot more and not for anything in particular no just to see you maybe a lil weird but you are so beautiful that I just cant help it. I haven't yet had the chance to talk to you at all really becuase as you know it's always so damn busy there.  Lately ive been more dressed up then usual do to some deaths and a lil work so if you were unsure as to who i am before im certain you know now. I doubt that you will ever see this so maybe i will try to talk to you if its not to busy one day but on the off chance that you do read this msg me i would love to spend some time with you.
summer,Toronto,m4w,Mini Cooper - m4w,"Thursday morning rush hour before 8:00. You let me in to your lane twice as we approached the Honda Indy closure and then I returned the favour. You are much younger than me with dark hair, sunglasses and you were drinking Starbucks. We smiled at each other as we both appreciated the kindness... Not something normal in rush hour!Wanted to say thank you again and also I thought you were very cute. If you would like to meet and let me buy you a drink, reach out and tell me what colour your car is and what colour and type of vehicle I was in."
summer,Toronto,w4m,Early insecurities - unnecessary ultimatums - w4m,"Dear girls and boys alike,I don't just like you, I've changed myself inside out for you to the point where I felt like a snake with an incessant need to shed its old skin for the sake of survival. I not only stayed with you but I found myself in places I would have never gone to on my own accord just to see your beautiful face and the familiar smile of generous companionship.I let you inside my head and ramshackle all my thought processes until we found ourselves reasonably synchronized. You made me turn over my outdated etiquettes only to lie to me about your true identity. Was I really that appalling to look at or did you know better than to show yourself because you judged me exclusively on my daytime attire? I adopted your core philosophy about artistic integrity only to be abandoned like an unwanted child on a church's doorstep. Bravo fearless one, guess there was one fear still left to conquer.I let you close to my body because of your need to announce to everyone that I am your best friend, but you never kissed me once or tried to use me - that way. However, you did use me, you worked hard to show everyone that we were equals when you were actually treating me as your academic sparring partner. I was not your friend, I was your adversary. I'm sorry I didn't read Sun Tzu earlier. Congratulations, I will never accomplish what you've so cleverly set out to attain.My love, I had always admired your lunacy and the courage that you brought to the battlefield but emotions are not all the products of an untamed heart. Emotions can be skillfully groomed and shaped into something we all desire but with absolutely no ability to control, you will always be fighting an imaginary war that will terrify you to your very core before any such event actually happens.My sweetest infatuation, everyone knows that they only need to mention your name once for me to come bolting out of the woods just so that my eyes can gaze at your beautiful slender body that I spent three years next to without worshiping. But you've put so much poison through your system that you're not aware of how much you affect me when your muscles need intense physical stimulation to feel better. We can only go home drunk and partied out so many times until the heart can no longer take your downward spiral without falling into a dangerous abyss. I am happy you've found happiness, without me.My prodigal friend, why do you call me your best friend when I barely know you? Why do you make all the rules for our future? Why do you despise society and people so much? Why do you find it perfectly acceptable to use your unpleasantly high IQ to create ultimatums to deal with children? You hold the right to walk out any day despite your so-called devotion until death, but, you also plan on dying early and expect to punish me for doubting your long-term presence?I've done all I can for you, but it was never enough. You wanted more, much more than I knew what to offer, and now that I've let you down, I'm just a painful memory that you want to bury. But your beautiful faces and haunting eyes are forever etched into my memory and I am a different person today because I have met you. Is it no longer considered appropriate for me to see you? Or will you only see me when I have made something of myself so that you can take comfort knowing that if it were up to me, I would have never let you go. I can't carve out a piece of my heart like this every time, and I don't want each of you to hate each other because of my actions, or inaction. There are some things that time does not heal."
summer,Toronto,m4w,grand caravan flat tire damsel - m4w,"It was a wet cold night, you were pulled up on the right lane of Confederation Pkwy northbound at Rathburn. Immobilized Caravan with a flat tire on your front driver side.I pass you. I could see the phone light on as if you were probably trying to get help. I had already passed you and it was obvious that you needed some help. As soon as the island ended,- I made my u-turn.I thought to myself, it's a minivan stuck on the side of the road with a lady and perhaps some kids in the back. I have to help or make sure they're okay. Already heading back south to help. I can see that your still on your device just passing the time. I make my move and u-turn yet again to go northbound once again. I assess the flat tire more as I pass you ever so slightly and back up just far enough so you are comfortable and can see that I am no threat to you in today's uncertain society. Just as I come out of my vehicle, you come out of yours. you tell me everything is okay and that it was a start to a ""$hitty"" night or weekend whatever that night was. My first reaction was that I thought there were kids in the van. You said no its just me. I felt relieved but then as I looked at you,- I was breathless. You were a sight for sore eyes. You told me that a tow truck was on its way, and that you were okay. I asked "" are you sure""? You were certain. I was heartbroken. I tried to find the words to insist on helping you. I drew a blank. I wanted to help not because you were gorgeous but it was just the right thing to do. I left the scene reluctantly. Hopped in my SUV and thought about how our interaction could have been different. If I could have changed anything about that night, it would be me changing your tire and you gaining a friend out of it. If you are somehow reading this,- I hope you are doing wonderful! I've had you on my mind for quite sometime...Do you remember what SUV I drove???Godspeed"
summer,Toronto,m4w,It's happening. - m4w,"We are friend zoning each other, and that is okay. I find friends; last longer, bother me less, and have more realistic expectations.I actually don't know what to call this thing we are doing.Enjoy the day."

summer,Toronto,m4w,Stunning blonde in wheelchair - m4w,"Hey,So you were with a friend, I think you got on at St.Andrew around 7:50. You locked your wheelchair into place and made some comments about how you wouldn't be going anywhere and I wished you were saying that to me. I wanted to say hi or something, but I was just too damn shy. I smiled at you, but I don't think you noticed. Now I fear I've missed my chance, since I got off at the next stop and didn't take the risk. But if you're reading this, I would love the opportunity to get to know you, maybe over coffee/tea, a drink, or even a meal.

Lovely flowers.

You're probably married, but just accept the compliment and feel good about it.Or get in touch with me. I'll bring the icing...."
summer,Toronto,w4m,Exotic perfection in the real world and beyond - w4m,"I know that am in love with you, it's beyond sexual attraction and infatuation; however, I can't help but think that if you knew my unconventional history and how old I have become, you would give me up in a heartbeat. You are so accomplished, and have worked with brilliant people in the recent past; coming here must have felt like a joke (as I found it a decade and a half ago). Now, people around me have chosen to stay here - permanently. But to me, living here is like living in a little utopia inside Deathly Hallows. I have to leave, but I'm not sure who wants to come with me if they call this place their one and only home. They claim that their affinity to the dazzling and exciting world outside is always eventually replaced by the familiar hum drum of rush hour pedestrians taking the subway. This is as real as it gets for them.I just want to be happy and I want to find happiness once again. For the last few weeks, you've made me so deliriously happy that I can't narrate it in words. I have many secrets - painful ones, ambitious ones, good ones -  but I can't tell people the many different walks of life I've lived in the past. I have to blend in and pretend that I am like everyone else around me. You are brilliant - I'm not so much, my options are limited. I am emotional and I can be broken, I am also a woman. I am no longer a girl as many people would still like to believe. I want to go all the way with you but I don't know where we stand yet. I suppose I am planning too far ahead in advance and I can't seem to get a grip on the first rung of the ladder thus making our situation more than a little awkward at the strategically planned random meets.At first, I just wanted to have coffee.Then, I just wanted to spend some time with you visiting the ROM or AGO.Then, I just wanted to move in together.Then, I wanted to say how I felt about certain things.Now... well now, you know how I feel. How am I supposed to ask you for all that when we haven't even really spoken?I just feel torn because I visited my bf for three hours. Do I really want the opportunity to have synesthesia inherited into future generations or do I want to live my life well and loved? I'm conflicted, I need to feel something real to decide, but after everything we do every afternoon and evening, you're not real to me just yet. Would you be interested in changing our casual happenstance? I am physical and true, I feed off any affection that I can get and I am familiar with my mutable sexuality. I thought of approaching you, but, I'm not sure if I'm just tired of guys or if I haven't met the right person yet. I tried not to be rude, I tried to ask but the words didn't seem to matter when I saw your beautiful eyes. You were headed to your destination and I was a passing plight. Wrong place at the wrong time I guess, but then again, when searching for the most opportune moment one must understand that patriarchy is still quite alive in modern society and that some people prefer that the guy takes the lead. Call me slightly old fashioned that way."

summer,Toronto,m4m,Once Date Night stood up F44 - m4m,I got stood up at Mivish's Once date night. I was in row F seat 44/45 and you were in seat 47.

'Some enchanted evening' comes to mind.
summer,Toronto,m4w,here what i think - m4w,"I think we met when you were in dream state. When people dream they can gain physical form throough some effect, maybe like a dream-sink. When I remind you how we met you assume iam not real, and you try to find me in a dream (well guess what you got it backwards). Iam real, and if you try to find me through pathological means Ill assume you can go back and forth and have some devious goals in mind. So if you cant approach me in real life like a real person you can fuck off. And I really feel negative energies around me which I can block physically, which are also very real, and i dont do it out of spite but sort of like very fluid programming language (like if this person does this for this reason he cant do it). I also dont know who surrounds me anymore, feels like a bunch of clowns for hire. What I want is my regular surroundings, and nothing to do with politics.I also remember some lyrics that go something like If my ass was a dream, would you stick your nose inside itfrom Dimitri"

summer,Toronto,m4w,It isn't one-sided - m4w,"Our break-up seems to you like a one-sided affair, even when we mutually agreed to break up. One-sided in that you feel hurt and hurt think I am relieved. But that assessment is kind of limited. When we fell in love, we agreed to be together, because it felt good. We invested in each other, quite deeply. I felt very strongly about you. You are wonderful, beautiful and so sweet, giving, and loving. But as it has to, conflict sets in, as fears kick in, really. And the way that we handle our fears and therefore conflict just doesn't feel good to either of us. We become adversarial, and forget who each other is. Reaction, after over-reaction. Am I relieved? Part of me, yes. That's the part of me that does not want to experience myself on autopilot and reacting poorly to you and your life. But a big part also hurts. It's a loss. Not only is it a loss right now, but it was also a series of losses and a series of heartbreaks. Each poorly handled conflict, each invalidation, each time that looking inward would have been so instructive and such a catalyst to a deeper connection, each time that was bypassed in favour of the pointed finger. Each ""I don't want to talk right now, you hurt me."" when that is the last thing I would ever want to do. We got undone by who we are at this stage in our emotional development.  I love you and miss you, but it just doesn't work right now."
summer,Toronto,m4w,M - m4w,"You are  a contradiction in every sense.You ask the Universe to send you that special someone, then you throw him away because he isn't convenient.You try to help others with their issues, when you haven't dealt with any of your own.You espouse a higher calling and this journey that you are on, but only to hide what you really are and how you have chosen to support yourself.News for you - the Universe isn't taking your calls anymore."

summer,Toronto,w4mw,re : Bulges - w4mw,"For a very long time I thought size mattered. I was a ""cock snob"" because of a few less than enjoyable experiences I had with men who were average or below in their pants. I specially looked for well endowed men. I thought I was having great sex, I'm more dominant in the bedroom so I did what I liked and I liked what I did. It felt good but rarely did I actually reach an orgasm with just penetration. I thought this was normal as most of the women I know find it difficult to reach orgasm from penetration so I thought that's just the way it is. I never really felt fully satisfied and was always left wanting more. Again, I thought this was normal. Then I started seeing someone new and at first I was hesitant because his penis is average size. But, Let me tell you, it's all about the ""motion of the ocean"" because this man has made me have ejaculating orgasms over and over again since about 2 weeks into us sleeping together. I thought squirting was a myth, I was wrong, so wrong, now I could probably write a book on the subject. So while a big sexy bulge is hot and stimulating to think about. If he doesn't put the effort in to know how to work it, you might as well get a super sized dildo and do it yourself."

summer,Toronto,m4m,Sinnerz Alley - m4m,"The eye of the storm caged the city with no escape. The dark sky heaved its warning as the rain began to pitter steadily on the pavement. This was going to be wicked and I was about to be one of the thousands to be caught in the chaos. As the darkness prevailed  I was damned to find cover as I was left feening for shelter like a addict looking for a fix. I have seen you from afar, glaring into my soul as if  trying to unlock the dark secrets that lie within. It was strange the way your dark eyes glistened in the darkness, but payed no attention to what was really going on. I search to find a closed rundown alleyway when I see the flick flash of light gaze across the sky and the loud roar of thunder scream in fear; the storm is here. The rain was getting angrier by the second when I saw you again; tall, with dark features and daring eyes that tempt my inner demon to question my fate. The connection was there but the chemistry is unreadable. I run down the alleyway for salvation when you comply, getting soaked from head to toe, what happened next could only be imagined in exotic dreams that leave the bed sheets dripping with desire. I glance behind my wet eyes and see you getting closer towards me, causing my blood to rise and my mind to panic with thoughts of what it is you really want. I reach a dead end when you disappear underneath the scaffolding that paints this dark place with a eerie mystery of what the true story really was. I stop to pace my thoughts when you jump up and stand towards me. My playful eyes trace your wet dark hair as you hands run through it, dripping the excess off your head. With your leather jacket open and your body exposed, I follow your hands as they skim down your ripped body towards your treasure trail, leaving beads of wetness to soak up the heat that beams off your chest. Your thumbs reach the top button of your jeans and with a hitch you rip it open releasing the cobra that was once tucked in its nest. My eyes flicker with the lighting as I now know what it is you want. I bite my lip and watch you swiftly lick your palm and stroke it in motion as I watch it awake from its dead sleep. Gripping tightly onto the railing,  you stick it through as it twitches for attention. Then without warning your scary dark eyes that had me trembling in fear locks onto mine like a devious spell. Before I could think, I found myself on the wet ground, my knees balancing me as I hold a tight grip around it in my quivering hands.""Suck it!"" Your words demanding and dominate  My cloudy eyes gazes up at yours as my warm lips get a taste of the salty treat I've been longing for and begin to suck. I  feel your cold hand on the back of my head, pushing it further down your cock until I felt it at the back of my throat. Trying not to gag on the thick monster meat in my sinful mouth, I work my special talents as you grunt to the sound of the forceful storm. You feel around in your jacket and pull out he red bottle, uncapping it you inhale sharply three times and hand the bottle to me. When I inhale the devils blood, my mind instantly becomes intoxicated; my heart begins to race rapidly and my blood boils and the only thing I want right now, right here, is that monster deep in my throat. Deeper and faster I go, feeling every inch down my swollen throat while saliva drips out of my mouth and down my chin. I gag and choke as you forcefully thrust harder and harder down my throat while the storm carries on in the background like a symphony. With not a soul insight, this continues until I feel it rising through the cobra. Was it fate? Or is it just a hot encounter. Your grunts get louder and your grip tightens as the warm liquid swarm my mouth like venom. Once every last drop is released, you quickly push me back and zip up. Within seconds you're gone like the storm that once was and here I am, sitting on the wet ground like a moth drawn to the flame and my thoughts tracing back to what just happened."
summer,Toronto,w4m,First time posting - w4m,"Basically my friend told me he found people on here before that he was looking for. I was at the Goodlife gym at Square One today and I saw you probably around 3-4?. You were on the top floor working out and you had black hair covering one of your eyes a bit. You were tall in comparison to me [I'm about 5'3] so probably about 5'11 -> 6? I've seen you before but usually as I'm getting there you move away from the equipment that I go to. I don't really know how to approach you because I'm a bit shy and your listening to music all the time and you look like you are really deep into your work out or thought. Today you were dripping sweat and it was the first time I really wanted to talk to you. I passed you a few times hoping to get your attention, and I asked one of the other girls to pass you in the gym twice to see if she could get a reaction out of you, but you were really paying attention to your work out. I went to the locker rooms a minute after you did and hurried to change, I saw you leaving and I followed you a bit, however you were on your phone talking to someone the entire time. Then you got across the street and the light changed so I couldn't catch up and I lost you.Today I think you were wearing a sleeveless shirt tank top I guess, and a pair of grey sweatpants."

summer,Toronto,m4w,Natural Value/Loblaws - Me with a Longos Shopping Box.... - m4w,"Hi. I bumped into you tonight at Loblaws in Richmond Hill, in the Natural Value section. Quite a surprise to say the least....I made a dumb joke about how ""of all the places"" to see you, since you work at a different grocery store which I usually shop at more frequently.You had just come from the gym. I guess you've given-up on just ""Street Fighting"" for your fitness? (we joked about that a while back, the last time I saw you when you were working)I'm really sorry if I seemed rude in any way whatsoever:  It was just bad timing. So many things in my life have been absolute crap since the last time I saw you....and most days I'm just not in the right frame of mind to be able to make conversation and socialize the way that I used to.I always loved talking with you. I wish I hadn't been feeling so shitty (and also incredibly nervous) when I saw you at Loblaws. I have good feelings about you.I'm still definitely interested in your art."

winter,Edmonton,m4w,"Looking for my neighbour, riddle within :) - m4w","First time posting this kind of thing, and I thought it would be fun to make a riddle, rather than the usual ""omg hot blonde who made eye contact with me for 3 seconds at starbucks"" or whatever.So, you live close to me, I can see your car parked from my window. It's a red ford with double doors and there is always a hockey stick in the back seat :) Generic so far? Read on.The car is usually parked next to a white car and sometimes another red car. I think it's a few young people (probably a couple at least) living in the house, and you have 1 dog in the back yard I think. He always barks when I walk by with my dog (hint). I haven't heard him in a while though, but he used to go nuts if anyone went down that alley.You have seen me walk past many times, usually with my dog in the morning. Once we said hi as you were heading to work and I walked past your house as you were leaving. Otherwise we have made eye contact several times. The main hint is that I can see your car from my living room window (which is big).The reason I wrote this is that you drove by around noon I think on Friday, and I was sitting outside on the step. I noticed you turned your head as you drove past, not like a glance as you went around the corner, but actually turned your head and looked as you passed by. I looked back.Anyway, I'm going to guess you are attached, as I am and you know this if you live on my block :) I'm also attached but in an open relationship, my partner is gone for another month.Total shot in the dark, last hint the house to your left is on the corner, and a family lives there with 1 kid. If you find this and read it, I'll be damned, and I think it would be exciting to meet even if it's discreet...:)If it really is you put either the cross street, your house number or my house number in the subject of your message. Also if you know who this is and your not interested that is cool, message me anyway if you like, in good fun. Have a good day!"

I know when we were younger I left in a bad way(you were 16 I was 19 you told your mom I was 18 haha). I was to young and immature to realize that I loved you from the minute our eyes met. It's been 12 or 13 years since we last saw each other camping and had fun in my tent. We also met up at brew house once which your hair was curled and absolutely beautifully and your smiles melted my heart. Looking into your eyes that day broke my heart because I know I could never have you. Remember my friend had to return your black furry jacket with cute little ears on it. Anyways you know I have kids now and a spouse... But you have never left my mind... Ever... You never will... You are the most beautiful woman I ever laid my eyes on. The sweetest woman I have ever met. Thanks for carrying me through WOW as well. I wish I could go back to when I was 19 and slap that kid that hurt you and tell him to never let you go but I can't. I know you will never read this but know you will be loved by me until the day I leave this earth. You truly are the perfect mix of beauty/geeky/your hilarious/ genuine/ soft hearted/ gifted in every way and you will always have a piece of my heart. I looked you up my fair share on Facebook (creepy I know). But I saw some pics and you are as beautiful as ever. Please take care of your beautiful self J. I know we didn't get to spend much time together which is my fault, but I am very thankful for the memories of you. Every time I think of you I smile and my heart warms. I would give up the world and everything I know for your heart. But that time is gone now and this helps a bit with the pain of knowing I will never get to hold you again. Keep your smile going J because I have never seen another smile that I hold so dearly in my mind and heart."

winter,Comox Valley,m4w,otter.... - m4w,"I see you...The Men That Don't Fit InBy Robert W. ServiceThere's a race of men that don't fit in,A race that can't stay still;So they break the hearts of kith and kin,And they roam the world at will.They range the field and they rove the flood,And they climb the mountain's crest;Theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood,And they don't know how to rest.If they just went straight they might go far;They are strong and brave and true;But they're always tired of the things that are,And they want the strange and new.They say: ""Could I find my proper groove,What a deep mark I would make!""So they chop and change, and each fresh moveIs only a fresh mistake.And each forgets, as he strips and runsWith a brilliant, fitful pace,It's the steady, quiet, plodding onesWho win in the lifelong race.And each forgets that his youth has fled,Forgets that his prime is past,Till he stands one day, with a hope that's dead,In the glare of the truth at last.He has failed, he has failed; he has missed his chance;He has just done things by half.Life's been a jolly good joke on him,And now is the time to laugh.Ha, ha! He is one of the Legion Lost;He was never meant to win;He's a rolling stone, and it's bred in the bone;He's a man who won't fit in."

winter,Comox Valley,m4w,Someday you will read this... - m4w,"Your doubt. . .Some day your presence before these words will bear witness to the doubt that lingers in your heart. . .Its an uncertain type of day. Its the type of dark grey day that imparts a slight queasiness into the pit of your stomach, an uncertainty that sends shivers into the core of your spine like the icy fingers of a ghost...You are cloaked and hidden within your office walls safe and away from the worlds prying eyes and ears. . . but not isolated nor shielded because doubt has brought you to these pages.You clutch your little puppy closer to your heart, holding him like a shield, your tiny, furry, confidant and protector.The day is cold and uncertain and did not go as expected. Your patients may have laughed, but many have cried. People wallowing in their own turmoil, addictions and challenges, fearing their own icy ghosts.You have come across these words, their inner meanings will only be known to you...Even though you have been taught by the best academics and have been awarded the highest rank of practitioners credentials, a slight and sickening disquiet lingers. Your milestones are no more than grey faded memories, hazy images of a time gone by.Reading these words will awaken that memory of me. Your heart will pound faster with each letter, word, and syllable consumed here...A memory will come racing back like that ghostly steeds hooves pounding harder and faster, leading rhythm to your heart, and just on the edge of taking your breath away.Your face is flushed, then drains, and that empty pit in your stomach reminds you we are all frail...Your heart is pounding, and when you recover your breath, color will return to your face, and your heart will bleed as mine has during these many, many months...;0-A thousand lifetimes have passed sincemy Passion first spoke unto me these words:'Go forth and speak that which is lockedwithin the timelessness of your soul and trustthe listener to understand.'But the voice of my Wisdom answered:'It would be better, perhaps, to leave the Truth unsaid;For the listener shall hear your words that clothe the Truth,but will not see through the veil of their disguise.'And hearing this caused my Passion to cry,for he knew that Wisdom always spoke withan enlightened reason;And my Wisdom wept also, for there was no joyin being right at his brother's expense.So now I come unto you that the thirst of my soulbe quenched and Truth be unveiled before theeyes of this world.0;-You gave no explanation. You never acknowledge my presence when we pass on the street...I expected, and yes, expectation is a poison within the soul...I fell in love with you that day. You touched my heart. My manifestations were coming true. Life was returning into my lonesome soul. I hoped that my fairy-tale dream would come finally come true after my years of loneliness...Though I strive for my higher level, my higher vibrations, my soul weeps and my passion cries... and I embrace that memory of what could have been...Could you possibly find it in your heart to say hello to me but only one time?Our eyes need not touch...but a mere tiny word of acknowledgement would contain my bleeding and slake the thirst of my soul...""I choose to love you in silence...For in silence I find no rejection.I choose to love you in loneliness,For in loneliness no one owns you but me.I choose to adore you from a distance,For distance will shield me from pain.I choose to kiss you in the wind,For the wind is gentler than my lips.I choose to hold you in my dreams,For in my dreams, you have no end.""  Rumi"

They use anything you have ever done and twist it to use against you later. What is nice is that I can look back now and I see it for what it was. I hear and see proof of the lies you told and still tell. I don't even know why you continue to portray yourself as victim. You were the problem. You will always be. You need to stop lying to woman to get them. Obviously you wouldn't want to expose what you have done to people, but there's no need to tell full out lies. Its wrong. Stop preying on weak women. I mean I do understand why you do. No normal empowered woman would want you. Just stop. Instead of lies, change your behaviour."

I hate that I still love you, I hate that you hurt me, and I hate that I can't let you go and move on. I've tried for so long and so many times, it's just that I feel numb inside. I thought that maybe my heart was dead. Until last night when I dreamt of you, and in the dream I ran into you out of the blue and pretended you weren't there, till you tapped me on the shoulder and said hi, Just seeing you my heart started to race, and I felt weak in the knees. Which is when I realized that even though I met great, attractive men, my heart is still with you. Which I hate as I know we can't be together and that you've moved on. I still wonder if you think of me or if we met in that dream, or maybe I've lost my mind. All I know is ill keep searching for someone like you even if it takes me the rest of my days, as I believe you were my twin flame. I hope that you are well, and happy with the life that you chose. Just know I love you and miss you tons, even though I'd never admit it. You will always have a special place in my heart. To Josh C from B"

I'm not 100% sure but if I don't put it out there then I'll never know. You once told me that I was foolish for browsing these ads thinking that it was you who was posting them and I guess you're right because here I am all by myself foolishly browsing them LOL. Come to think of it, if these posts are from you then I guess you could be wrong and I could be right? Or maybe we're both right? Or maybe we're both wrong. Anyway you slice it, the bottom line is that I miss my family unimaginably; mine, yours, and ours created together.. Especially my ""first born"" LMFAO!!Jk. She will always own me. The laughter and joy we used to share will never be forgotten. If this is you, riddle me this;Four years ago we went up north for a weekend. While we were there I stole you away for the afternoon so I could show you one of my favourite places. I'll never forget the way your skin glowed in the late afternoon sun as we relaxed watching it turn the sky pink. What did we see in the water just before we left?Do you remember the blanket in the woods beers on the trunk the walk that was interrupted laying on the couch watching movies together in your little white booty boy shorts the showers together teatime? I could never forget any of it. When it all started between you and I, where was our first kiss and how did you get my phone number?We lived in Cowtown for a little bit. It was an OK place I guess. A little older, one of those ""BC box homes"" as you call them. The fish tank and spaghetti..the sugar bowl that missed the grin.. The fire so hot it made the stove glow just like your complexion while you were carrying our first child together. And what about the neighbor jumping the fence with a fire extinguisher or when the fire department showed up ha ha ha ha. What was on fire when the neighbour came over? Why did the fire department show up?If this is you and then the answers will be there because nobody in the world except you could know the answers to these questions. Nobody in the world is you. I heard somebody say that you wanted to be my friend. You already have friends and even a best friend or two, besides I think we're already way past that. I WANT MORE. I want to be your BEST best friend. truly, madly, deeply, with all my love; Your ""goof"""

It's because you're afraid to like the things about me that you hated about yourself. I get it. You've made changes in your life and you should be proud of your accomplishments. I just needed the universe to know that I felt the connection and I am genuinely sad that you won't let us explore it. I wish I needed a new car so you could sell me another one."

But I saw the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, in walmart yesterday, late afternoon/early evening, around 430pm. You had dirty blonde hair down past your shoulders, and were wearing some tight black yoga pants.You were ahead of me in the check out line, and I believe it was your young daughter that was making a bit of a fuss as you were waiting on the cashier. I was about to say something to you, when some scrub looking kid/guy came up to walk out with you. I'm not sure if it was your man, or just a brother or friend - but, the two of you did not match at all lol, and seemed like you were pretty frosty toward each other.Anyways, like I said, I've never done anything like this at all; but I was just amazed at how such an attractive woman, was in Vernon, let alone in walmart. If you see this, get back to me, I would enjoy talking to you, and finding out more about you. Perhaps over a coffee, or a game of pool, sometime. I wish I could remember more details, but honestly, I was a bit stunned at your beauty. And your ass in those yoga pants was beyond distracting lol. But you were very courteous to the cashier, and very nice to your child as she was getting impatient. I thought you were classy, sexy, and seemed like a nice person. Hopefully, I can find out for myself....I know the odds are very slim... but when you see something that good, you can't just let it pass you by!"

winter,Kelowna / Okanagan,m4m,Black Friday (morning) - ESSO on Leckie - m4m,"You, in your late 30s or maybe very early 40s, were fueling and then putting oil in your big, grey truck. Your BC license plate started with C, ended with 4 numbers and was in the format CX - XXXX and you had 3 letters (starting with S) written diagonally in black up the right side of your tailgate. I pulled up behind you wearing my work clothes and began fueling up my car when suddenly a big, white, supercharged truck had pulled on to the highway and made a lot of (unnecessary) noise as it sped off. We both looked at each other and smiled, acknowledging just how unnecessary the noise was. As we were sharing that moment I was about to say something cheeky about the noise but was able to stop myself when I realized your truck could just as easily make that much noise (but didn't -- thank you for not being one of those guys ;)I was totally captivated by you when I pulled up (and even said to myself before I got out of the car: ""gawd damn I find him incredibly attractive"", but then, after our eyes met over that shared smile, I experienced that extremely rare, and totally cliche, dream weaver moment. And, although I didn't notice a wedding ring, the fact that only 5% of the male population is gay, and the fact that you were driving a big truck (further reducing those odds) paralyzed me from engaging in any kind of small talk. (Much less being extremely forward and paying you the compliment that was on my mind.)I followed you across the highway (on my way to work) and you turned right off of Leckie in to the complex with Safeway, Subway, TD bank, as I continued onward.And now here I am, over 12 hours later, not only discovering that a missed connections website actually exists, but posting an ad on it! ...Like all messages in a bottle, this one represent a tiny sliver of hope. Knowing that you will likely never see this, much less respond, I wanted to say thank you for reminding of what ""that feeling"" feels like. I hope you continue to, unintentionally?, make other peoples' day, like you have mine today.Cheers!"

I think I found the missing picture of your child sized penis. I believe you accidentally sent it when you replied to my strictly platonic ad. I think you may have meant to attach this to an email to your doctor so you can find out if perhaps you have a testosterone deficiency that is responsible for the tiny size of your penis or if perhaps you can get some antibiotics to clear up that unsightly cyst that appears to be forming on your tiny weiner. I suggest you get that looked at quickly as it will soon dwarf your tiny pecker, or perhaps leave it as it may be your only chance at packing something downstairs. I have attached the picture you sent me so you can get it back to your doctor ASAP. You're welcome!"

winter,Victoria,w4m,Re:RE: Advice - w4m,"Yep, there is no shortage of lying douchebags who don't give a shit about anyone but themselves. Do you suppose they consider, even for a second, the look on their spouse's face the moment they found out about their ""loved one"" has been sleeping around. Do they not think about the tears? That of their spouse and those of their children? Nope. It's all about them, and I wouldn't mind betting that if someone suggested what's good for the gander is good for the goose, they would adamantly resist the suggestion that their wife would be capable of cheating on them and even if so, they would be upset, jealous, and feel violated. And you're right - carrying on online hurts just as much - otherwise why the need for sneaking around? What a sad way to live your life! Sad and pathetic."
winter,Victoria,w4m,RE: Advice - w4m,"Don't be such a dick. You got married for a reason. Marriage is supposed to be for better or for worse. I am sick of seeing all these married or partnered people on here seeking for solutions outside of their partnership. If you truly need to be with someone else then do that but do that after leaving who you are with currently. There is no greater betrayal than having your partner cheat on you. And pro-tip having conversations with someone other than your partner where you are flirting, sexting, sharing pics etc... is still cheating. In fact, to some people emotional cheating is worse than one random romp in the hay.If you ever truly cared about your partner you would do the right thing and move on before moving into someone else."

To those who said you can't fall in love with someone at first sight .. I can't explain to you all just how mesmerizing this girl truly is. She comes across selfless, and she had my full attention with a single smile, that wasn't directed in my way for starters. She was genuinely kind, and friendly. She is too beautiful for her own good. Not in the , Cake make up, fried hair, eye make up to the eyebrows and skimpy clothes kind of beautiful which seems to be the new style. In the way of, truly herself. She wore minimal make up, non revealing clothes, her hair was tousled perfectly messy framing her pure face beautifully. I sound like a cheesy freak.. I realize that, but I can't get over it. This was to thank everyone for the kid words, but sadly Emily's boyfriend sent me a message, telling me she was taken. That sucks big time but I appreciate him letting me know, but I wonder why he's on missed connections in the first place? To her boyfriend. You have the most flawless person I've ever seen, with something about her that seems to capture everyone's attention, she's beautiful in Every way and I haven't even talked to her. I can't imagine how lucky you must feel, I wish you all the best together. Seasons greetings to Everyone. And you, my dream girl <3"

Me? 24, tall, brown hair, dark eyes , usually wearing plaid, maybe you've seen me? I've seen you only 3 times, First was at fairway market by cedar cross, two kids in the stroller and handling everything so well. Second was walking across shelbourne, I was the truck waving at you. Third, was at the Nellie library branch in Victoria.I was never a hopeless romantic and I don't know what you're doing to me. I've seen beautiful women. And then there's you. There's this amazing light around you that traps anyone, I've felt an inch of jealously watching another group of guys check you out. You have an amazing body, and you don't seem to feel the need to show it. Your smile left a mark in my memory and your laugh, that giggle.. Replays over and over. I've been asked for my number recently more times then I can count but haven't given it out once. I heard you talk to the kids in the library, and another lady sitting next to you sharing nanny stories, and heard you introduce yourself.My friends think I'm crazy for going for the runaway dream girl of mine, and I am. Please if you read this or someone who knows of the brunette/red shimmer green eyed slim lady that works with two kids in the shelbourne/Mckenzie/cedar hill area, let me know. I'm not extremely fortunate, but I'm well off, I'm tall, I love cuddles, own a truck and a nice piece of land.

Why can't men focus on the women in their life instead of looking for new arm candy? They would be surprised what paying attention to their partner can actually do. I know that no man I have been with that has focused on us has had issues with getting enough quality sex and good times. It is only when things become problematic that all the passion and fun dies down. It takes two to make a relationship work. I wish they could figure that out. Anyway, good luck and I hope things work out for you :)"

winter,Victoria,m4w,Beautiful mature woman - m4w,"To A. It was very nice to meet you today around 2 pm. You were very gracious as I awkwardly tried to bridge the gap between my shyness and your confident sexual magnetism. You were not shocked as I commented on your mature beauty, even hotness. Instead, you calmly reached out to introduce yourself and, despite the soft landing of your rejection, greeted me with kindness and warmth. Obviously, your personality is also refreshing and different. Still I was a little embarrassed by my own forthrightness, reciprocating your 'have a nice weekend' and departing to escape my discomfort. I regret that now. I should have stayed and joined you, if permitted, and had a good conversation. You showed me that you are more than a one dimensional person and I wish that I had done so as well. As an introvert I am naturally more engaging as a conversationalist than I am as a ""player."" In fact, myself acting as a player is very amusing. ""The blind leading the blind"" But, I have to say even shy guys have their share of strong attractions, they're just uncomfortable acting on them. Anyways, if you'd be okay having a coffee together sometime when you're there again, I promise to be more relaxed and personable, just as you had been with me. :-) Take care, L."

You kept going out of view as you spoke on the phone and then eventually, you were gone. I wanted to say, it was a captivating 30 minutes."

We just started to really get to know each other and all of a sudden I come across as an ass and start acting like an out of control, psycho, crazy person. I know that I have ruined it between us, and that you'll never ever want to call me, e-mail me, or see me ever again....I do understand. We have known each other for such a long time and I have come to care for you deeply. I wish that I could take back what I said, unfortunately I can't and I will regret it every day for the rest of my life. I'm asking you for a second chance, I'm hoping you can see it within yourself to let me prove to you that I'm so much more than I was. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. ~J"

You are so freakin cute I can't stand it! Long curly dark hair, big beautifully shaped eyes... I came by a couple times this past week hoping you'd be there so I could tell you all this but no luck. At least I can put words to tongue (or keyboard) on here because your smile literally turns my brain to mush.. every time I saw you I forgot to simply look at your tag or ask your name! I probably wouldn't have even remembered my own name if you asked me in those moments. Such sweet full lips.. A gorgeous mouth-watering flawless body that no work clothes could hide.. Seriously, you could totally make a pair of dirty coveralls look sexy. You drip natural beauty top to bottom, I'm completely infatuated with you!! With your sensual delicate smile, soft pleasurable voice, and pleasant way your carry yourself I can tell that you must have a personality to match your physical features. I'm crossing my fingers that we can get to know each-other better, there isn't a single thing about you that doesn't give me butterflies thinking about. The last time we talked I teased you a little about the music that was playing on the radio near your till, I asked if it was your choice (bad 80's pop). My mind went blank when you smiled and I couldn't think of anything clever to say after that. I swear one time this past summer you gazed into my eyes as I was leaving (I did 2 double takes) but maybe twas just wishful thinking. If not, and if by some small chance you read this before I bump into you next I would die of excitement if you got back to me!"

Two of the only people not really dressed up for halloween.You said something to me, but I couldn't hear. You grabbed my hand and we crept closer. My thigh started rubbing yours and I looked deep in your eyes. I grabbed you close and pulled you into my body. Two became one on the dance floor. We became intoxicated with each other, grinding our bodies in rhythm. I grew a little hard, and I know you not only noticed... but liked it as you pulled my hips harder into you. I slipped my hand into your jeans and gripped your tight little ass. Then, suddenly, I had to part ways as I saw my GF... I went and talked to her for a bit and when she was out of sight again, I came up behind you and grabbed your hips, pushed my bulge up against that great ass and we started grinding like there was no tomorrow. We got low, couldn't keep our hands off each other. I caressed your whole body - and one sexy body at that - in along sensual dance, while Pigeon Hole was putting on a killer show 5 feet in front of our faces. I felt alive for the first time in a while. I wanted to go back to your place and explore every curve of that body and lose ourselves in a naked tangle of hedonism... and I saw the GF again.

winter,Victoria,m4w,Memory of you Torments me - m4w,"way more then I ever expected, see it was supposed to go away, I was supposed to be devastated for maybe six months, get over it and move on with my life, and always carry the memory of you in a positive manner, and I do for the most part, shit was fucked up I was fucked up, It was all super intense, it just worked right off the bat and it all seemed perfect everything felt like it was going the way it should, but I failed to properly get to know you and that upsets me because your the person responsible for this stupid depression I have to deal with and im tormented most nights with reminders of you I dwell and I cry and I colour, I go through pictures, most of the time with tears collecting on my eye lid pain so heavy it physically renders me unable to move, almost like a vegetable, and i find myself staring at pictures on the coffee table that i could no longer hold because my arms got too weak, i want to get up and move or put them away so i don't have to look at them but I'm so empty and I'm so helpless that all i can do is stare at them with the most helpless feeling I frequently endure, and as time carries on it builds up and each and every day I'm not there just adds up, I thought being free would be awesome i could go out whenever I want and not have to worry about answering to anyone, but missing you kind of ruined the excitement of being free i just don't have a spring in my step anymore and i just kinda don't care, I ended up becoming a hermit anyways again isolating myself, that corny saying ""you have ruined me for other women"" makes me laugh but theres some truth in it, because I feel ruined, I had a few meaningless flings i thought would help to forget you but it just made it worse, I committed to the fact that I am not suitable boyfriend material and I promised myself never to let anyone care about me ever again the image of your trembling lips and watery eyes as you begged me not to be a shitty person still haunts me and I wish I was who i am now back then, it would have made a world of a difference I wish i had like one year between my previous relationship and you so that i could have been reminded that single life isn't what its all cracked up to be, I wish i got what i needed to get out of my system before I met you I wish i was more ready for you but i wasn't, Someone has weaselled there way into my life the past few months, and I don't know why she bothers with me, I don't know how many times she's held me as I bawl my eyes out to this day over you, she knows you broke me, i tried to push her away explaining how badly i treated you how I was a liar a cheater, pretty much scum, but for some reason she's always there for me, I don't know what she expects out of me because i told her Im too fucked up to date and that I'm a cheater, and I deserve to pretty much rot alone festering in the darkest depths of my depression for the rest of my life until i can finally just be done with this shit and be buried I'm sure you would agree thats what I deserve, so heres an update: I'm still serving my time, I am incarcerated in my own mind, You might as well know this so you can sleep a little happier knowing I'm still all torn up over it, its what you wanted and I'm accepting and dealing with it i deserve it im sorry again still to this day."

Or maybe you do, but it's not time for you to be with one another yet. Isn't it funny how so many people letchu down and sometimes it feels like the whole fucking world is on your shoulders and no one gives a fuck unless it will benefit them. No one wants to listen to you being upset again, there's always something better they could be doing. Selfish. People are so plastic it's sickening. Isn't it fucking funny how you see someone that seems perfect to you and you never see them again? You hope to run into them but no luck. Yet, you keep running into the same fucking idiot[s] again and again and again. It's bullshit. It would be nice to think that for all the bullshit things that happen and as alone as you can feel with no hope in your opposite gender, after being fucked over so many times despite how much time has passed, that one day, sometime, things will work out for you and you'll fall in luv, be happy you found your sig. other. Instead of constantly hearing so and so got married! - we're celebrating our 800th anniversary! - we just bought a new house! - i just maxed my rich luvers cards! or wtfever. It'll be your turn. Maybe. Here's to the broken hearted. Those who feel alone and truely no one gives a fuck about you or if your hurting. You cry on your floor, scream to your music, punch the walls, sit on your bed staring at nothing thinking about everything, i can understand. Hopefully one day shit works out right and we can learn to trust and confide in that special someone. Till then our walls go up, we isolate ourselves in hopes of not getting hurt another fucking time. We constantly flexuate between luv isn't for me to luv will find me one day, smile. It's getting colder outside, but no where near as cold as me. Shit will work out just when it's supposed to, that's what i keep telling myself. Till then, keep your head up, try to. Shit gets rough but it's the scars that we have that makes us intelligent, able to recognize our own kind and say, we survived. Not everyone who reads these ad sites is plastic. The shit will pass. I know i'd rather be alone than surrounded in false company. Signed,Just a girl in her 20s."

winter,Winnipeg,m4w,Thinking about you! - m4w,"So much time has gone by and still I think of you every day. You were everything I always wanted and needed and yet I pushed you away, time after time. You were patient, kind, caring, genuine, funny and smart. You tried so hard to be passionate and thoughtful and it came from your heart. I was emotionally and physically unavailable even unkind and hurtful.Things ended horribly and I've never said I am sorry. I am SO sorry. I think we could have had a wonderful life together. I loved you and your son but found it so hard to express my feelings and emotions. I realized, when it was too late and you had already left this city, that I pushed so hard because I was so afraid that I would lose you and I could not deal with a broken heart. I worried that you would find someone better, smarter, more attractive, a better dad and that I would lose you both. Logically and intellectually I realized that I needed to give more and just let things take its natural course. I was afraid to let you see my vulnerability and in doing so showed you a cold, uncaring jerk. I couldn't let the walls down and felt I had to protect my heart, my sanity.I could go on and on endlessly but the bottom line is ... I am sorry. I've thought about sending you an email, but worried that it would go unread. I realize it is unlikely you will ever see this message and in one sense I hope you do not as this would mean that your are happy, content and in a relationship that you deserve. On the other hand, I pray you do see this, not so that you can accept my apology, but rather just to try and understand me a little better.I find myself becoming much more emotional with age and when I reflect on my life my mistakes are painfully obvious. Having said that, I do feel I am a better person today than I was yesterday, than I was ten years ago.I hope you are well. I love you and always will."

winter,St John'S,m4w,looking for my high school sweetheart - m4w,"a long shot, but hopefully worth it. We were high school sweethearts way back in the late 1960's. I won't mention names, but your first name began with B. We met in the summer of 1968 or 69. You lived one street away from me. I can't remember how we met, (through mutual friends,I think) but we were inseparable that summer. you were so young and beautiful and innocent, and I was a scrawny shy boy, don't know what you saw in me. But we really hit it off, it was never a sexual thing, I don't think I even kissed you, mostly because I was much too shy. It was the best summer of my entire life, until your mom drove me away, because another girl threatened you to stay away from me, so I left you aloneI never even had a chance to say goodbye to you, I just disappeared, I guess because I was too young and lacked the self-confidence to fight for you. I went on to become a very well educated well-respectedprofessional, but I guess your mom never saw my potential, I was just a quiet, shy young boy from a poor family, who was hanging around you too much. Now that I'm much older, as are you, and life has changed so much over those years, I often find on those dark days my mind drifts back to that summer, when the biggest decisions we had to make was which album to put on the stereo next, or whether to go for a walk or just sit on your front steps. They were such peaceful times, just you and I making small talk, and perfectly confortable just sitting next to each other without even speaking. I loved sitting next to you. even though you didn't use makeup or wear perfume, you had this beautiful smell, like a baby after his bathtime. Several years later I heard that you had met someone and got married, and although I was devastated, all I could think of was What a lucky guy. I know that if we had stayed together, we would have eventually married, because we were 2 bodies sharing one soul.I saw you again a couple of years ago at Mcdonalds. I knew it was you, because you hadn't changed a bit, you glanced my way but didn't acknowledge me. my heart skipped a few beats, but again I was too shy to say hello, or maybe I was afraid you wouldn't recognize me, so I just carried on with my hum-drum life, but I keep hoping I'll run in to you again. I tried to track you down on facebook using your maiden name, but no luck. even after 45 years or so, there's still not a single day that I don't think of you, and there are times when I would give anything just to talk with you again, or even just sit next to you. I'm not trying to upset your life, hopefully you're happy with your life, I bet you are, because you're that type of person, beautiful inside and out. If you recognize this story, please contact me. We owe it to ourselves, to see if that magic is still there, and maybe to say the things we never said back then"

You were looking kind of good so if you are a hooker let me know. I wouldn't mind trying you out.
winter,Halifax,w4m,Guy in black BMW - w4m,"A friend told me about this, so I figured I'd give it a shot.I was waiting for a friend outside on Barrington st on Friday (December 4th). You pulled up in a black BMW 2-door and parked at a meter. You got out and fed change to the meter and started to walk away, when the homeless man sitting across from your car asked you for change. You said you had just fed the meter all your change but asked if he could keep an eye on your car for you for 10 minutes. At first I thought that was a real dick move, but when you returned you came back with a slice of pizza and a drink for the homeless guy as thanks for watching your car. You shook the homeless guy's hand and got in your car and took off.I was really moved by your generosity. I also feel bad for judging you pre-maturely, I pegged you as a typical rich asshole when I shouldn't have. I'd love to get to apologize to you in person and maybe get to know you. You were wearing maroon pants, a black leather jacket and aviator sunglasses. You had brown skin and fascial hair. You seemed pretty exotic looking to me lol.

winter,Hamilton-Burlington,m4w,Mezclar - m4w,"It's been 3 or 4 years since that night at what was 'The London Tap House'- I've lost track of the days at this point in my life. It was your birthday and I offered to walk you home in the rain since you refused a taxi. You obliged and we were on our way until your friend had boyfriend troubles and she called you out on the street. Of course, I can recall every last detail of this night, but this description alone is enough for you to recognize it's, well, you. It was situations like this that led me to believe that during all the years I had been infatuated with you that it was not my fault we never ended up together. I blamed opposing forces of nature and troubled winds through the universe for the missed opportunities when all the while it was only me. It's taken all this time to realize it so, even with all these years thinking about you.I was up to my neck in God knows what the whole time I'd known you. Maybe it was the substances, maybe it was just being young. Nevertheless, I consistently found some way to ruin my chances to hold your hand, to kiss you, to say how I truly feel. Innocent acts amidst current societies expectations but this is what I dreamed about. Nevertheless, I've tried to find you at your place of work- or where you used to- to ask you out, again. For another chance and to show you that I have changed in every aspect of the word. That's not to say it may be a good thing in your eyes but I need to know. There's always been some part of me that wondered- this very small yet significant detail that I'm missing in my life. There was never that closure people talk of...Estrella, will your light ever shine in my life again or has it gone out forever?"

Anyway, tonight i'm sure I had seen you looking for me out the window as I left and as I had passed by again shortly after with my food, so I have decided to finally let out what I have wished I could say to you for a while...I don't come for the coffee, obviously.. I come to get coffee so often for the small chance that I may actually ask you to hang out sometime, ask if youd like to get to know each other a bit more.

winter,London,m4w,The Banishing ... - m4w,"Nightmares kept coming in the night. The hurtfulness of others was not even escaped in dreams as betrayals and rejections, over the years emerged even into that most private of moments.Waking was another distortion of reality. How can the person I most cared for suddenly be gone without a word or notice or discussion. Now I am forced into accepting that love towards anyone is something that others fear. Making the mistake to express such leads to exquisite punishment.To speak of connection caring or tenderness, these are not things of the earth. They are only the ideals of myself. As I look around I see love not. Even that couple across from me in the cafe. Does one of them know that the other is going to betray or abandon them sooner or later. One left broken and the other has become the destroyer.Love is not real. What we experience as love is only a masking of something else. A promise that is not possible as the human heart of the majority of people is a thing of selfishness and deception. Look around at the world and see that it is so.Love is banished now into a world where there is only the harsh reality that we all live alone and die alone."

winter,London,m4w,'shop girl - m4w,"Why do we hurt most mercilessly those we love the most? I loved you in the most terrible way, where being with you was just as unbearable as being without. I am the moth to your flame, and the failure of our romance is my fault. Such love is not stable. It is not the sort that can survive the regimented ways in which we live our lives. Such is the nature of all excess.But I do love you, so much. More than anyone will, and in a way no one else can: I wake up thinking of you and go to bed reminiscing about us together. One might say I am hung up on you and need a good lay, but I have had plenty, of course far better than we were together. This persistent, annoying, beautiful sentiment I bear to you, while physical, is more intensely so. I know you suffer every day simply because, much like my self-destructive affection, you also do not fit into this world; and this hurts me, for some reason. All the time.I hope you are happy, and that you never think of me."

My poorly placed keys ended up falling out of my coat pocket during the hike, but I didn't realize it until long after we had returned to the parking lot. I thought we were going to get stranded in Canada and that my friend was going to miss her train out of Boston the next day, but a group of hikers eventually approached us and asked if one of us had lost a pair of Volkswagen keys. My heart lifted! Apparently, some boulderers had found them! My friend ended up running back down to meet up with these life-saving boulderers, and they gave her back my keys. She was in such a hurry to get back to me, so we could carry on with our plans for some much needed wine tasting that she didn't even think to get your number (or maybe she was just distracted by your blue eyes).

winter,Niagara Region,w4m,Crazy in Love! - w4m,"Love makes you crazy don't you think? You meet an incredible man and have a mind blowing connection that rivals anything you have ever felt. There it is, you met your dream guy, your last stop, the one that you want to spend a lifetime with, the one who you love the way he smells, the way he walks...the way he talks....everything. Even the little quirks that would normally drive you nuts you love! So there you are, laying beside this amazing man watching him sleep, inhaling his scent, enjoying the heat radiating off his body and nothing else matters. It is certainly an amazing feeling until one day something changes...........it could be anything really.....a misunderstanding........a stupid mistake......a moment you can never take back. Maybe the feelings were never same for both lovers......no matter what the situation the bond starts to change between the two people and the relationship comes to a dramatic end with one person usually running away and one person chasing in a desperate attempt to keep their lover. Any attempt is made by one person to fix the broken relationship and heal the wounds and the pain. Letters written, texts sent, calls made and the list continues while one person chases a lost lover then didn't want them anyways. It is usually in vain until the chaser finally comes to the conclusion that they are acting silly, they are chasing a dream that once was, they catch a glimpse of themselves and realize they are acting like that person that we all look down on and say they are acting crazy. The name of the lost lover lingers in their heart, in their mind and happy memories bring bitter sweet tears of what was and what could have been. Not a day goes by that my lips don't whisper your name and my heart does not beat for you. Goodbye for now my love."

I will have to admit i was sensually doing myself really good , teasing myself to cummm really close and then stopping and starting again until i came really hard all over a towel that was in my car from my swim at the club . Being done i naturally got outta my car and started into the store when i heard the SUV- that was parked next to me- start up and backed out ... i immediately freaked as i knew whoever was in it saw EVERYTHING i just did , FUCK i thought but just then as they drove away the window rolled down and from the inside a female voice shouted "" FUCKING HOT "" as she stuck her arm out the window and waved good bye as she drove off and headed towards the street. ... In an instance i was both embarrassed and turned on - but mostly turned on - so here i am looking for that girl or girls who watched me stroke my cock until i creamed all over myself and wondering if they might like to watch me do it again ( since the cat is outta the bag now ) ... if you see this tell me what i was driving so i know it is you or ""you's"" so we can ""maybe"" try doing this again ...btw...TOTALLY HOT !!ps. Just want you to know that im going crazy thinking about how much of a turn on that was for me !!!"

It was mid August and you had just exited Herb n' Spice and walked past me as I was unocking my bike. It was one of those moments where everyone else in the vicinity blended into the background and you and I connected for a few seconds. You even looked back to check me out (at least I tell myself that...)

We're only 5 hours apart, I would love to see if we have stuff in common and see what happens :)"
winter,Ottawa-Hull-Gatineau,w4m,Craft Show - w4m,"This is a long shot, because who reads these things? Horny teenagers seeking older women they ogled on a bus? Nervous divorces with too many solitary evenings, hoping just anyone replies? I'm not like that. It's not that I'm better -- I totally blew it hitting on you today, for instance -- but I'm young, I love my work, I have a very full life. But then you walked up to my table. I had been checking my phone, then I looked up into your eyes and my life changed. Or, at least, my life could change if you magically read this and responded. My stomach did a back flip and my heart started pounding. Suddenly I knew that when people talk about being hit by a lightning bolt, or about love at first sight, those things REALLY HAPPEN. Not often, not ever in my case...but for the first time I doubted all my years of cynicism and disappointment. Maybe it is true that all you have to do is wait. Maybe you just get turned around and trampled on so that you are precisely WHO you are, WHERE you are, on the very moment when something like THIS happens. But then I fucked it up. You asked for my card and I gave you, thinking that would be enough. You took it, we chatted, I just figured you felt it too and you would email. But you haven't yet. Maybe you don't know what to say. Maybe you didn't feel it too. Whatever the reason, I'm hoping that just by sending this out to the ether, my weird little inside energy person will attract your weird little inside energy person and you'll decide to send me an email just to say hey. (I didn't make that up. That's a thing...some cultures believe we have energetic selves that live in a parallel universe.) Or maybe this will be a painful lesson in why one should EXCHANGE goddamn business cards. Ok! Well...here's hoping trolls have a short attention span."

You are perhaps one of the most beautiful women I have ever spoken with. I wanted to ask you more, but my position (being in uniform) prevented me and the fact that I am older than you, probably MUCH older, may have made you uncomfortable. With your red hair and sapphire eyes, all I have thought about is your face....your beautiful, smiling face, and the way you blushed and looked down. You have the most radiant smile. Had I asked for your number, it would have been wrong, on many levels. I wish...I wish we had met in another life, you are so very, very beautiful and I would have made it my mission in life to see you wake everyday with that same smile on your sweet, sweet lips."

winter,Ottawa-Hull-Gatineau,m4w,Around Town - m4w,"I wasn't sure if I should post this, but after awhile of seeing other posts, I thought, why not.See, I'm a person that is extremely visible, and active in the community, especially in the downtown area. I can be spotted from pretty far away. The reason for this is quite simple. I drive around in a big powered wheelchair.Almost everywhere I go, people often stare at me. I no longer mind, in fact, I'm used to it. To me, it tells me that you're at least curious about who or what I am. Sadly, my presence often intimidates people, and makes some feel uneasy around me, which is understandable. If I saw someone booting around town driving a mini tank, I'd be kinda freaked out too.Anyways, I'm here to tell you all that it's ok, there's no reason to feel intimidated, or shy around me. Even though, I may look and sound different, I'm really just a regular guy. You can talk to me, and I'm very good at carrying a conversation, and I have a lot of interests. If you want, you can even ask about my disability, if it's in a respectable manner.I can't speak for all physically disabled people, but generally speaking, we're pretty easy going people.The same goes for me as well.I'm VERY approachable, but I'm kind of shy when it comes to approaching others. You may be missing out on getting to know someone who's truly unique.I also want to say thank you to anyone that has held a door opened for me, or anything like that. It can be tough getting around the city, so I truly appreciate any help offered.Don't be shy."
winter,Ottawa-Hull-Gatineau,w4m,Seriously ?! - w4m,"I've always really liked you, you know that. However, I will not tolerate the way you treat me any longer. I'm so tired of always being the one reaching out - I fear it makes me seem needy, when really I'm just damn horny for you. I'm not some twenty year old you picked up at the bar, nor am I your wife, girlfriend or ex girlfriend whatever the f**k she is. That shit is either over or it isn't - if you're done with her then let it be really over and stop hiding...or is it not really over? My pussy is not some drive thru you can visit when you have a craving either. As much as we make beautiful music together, you should know that there are plenty of contenders out there.. You are easily replaceable. As am I. I'm a person with thoughts and feelings and I treat people the way I like to be treated: with honesty, kindness and respect. It's a lesson you'd do well to master darling grasshopper."

winter,Ottawa-Hull-Gatineau,m4w,You're a Belle - m4w,"I'm not sure why I didn't ask you for your number. I'm leaving the city today, I suppose I didn't think there was any point. I also suppose that asking for your number isn't quite as special as asking for a goodbye kiss. Text messages are usually not very special. Craigslist isn't very special either, but how else does one send an aimlessly sentimental message into the ether? There was something about you that made an impression on me. I keep thinking about it as I watch the scenery pass by. I feel strange - stranger than I usually do. I also feel silly for what I said then, and for typing this now. I guess if there's any point to this message, it's to let you know that you've made me feel strange and silly. I like that. There are also questions I wish I could ask you. Conversations we'll almost certainly never have. Did you cast a spell on me? How often do dances like those come to you? What about kisses? Does your heart move as easily as your body? If so, how difficult must it be to capture? Do you braid your own hair? How long is it supposed to take to fall in love?"

You were wearing a tuque. Your dog is tan, medium-sized and I think s/he's a mixed breed. You look like you might be in your mid-to-late thirties, but I'm really bad at guessing ages.

I've changed in the time we weren't in contact. I am not interested in a one-sided one-person takes all kind of nsa situation - you and I are too old for that and you know how high the stakes are. If I'm really so hot and so great at this and the other thing, and if you really wanted me as much as you say or claim to, you would find a way to communicate without compromising our situations. Yet you don't. And I get frustrated. Then I take things a step further and you get mad. Screw that shit! Like you I want to have my cake and eat it too. Like you I am used to calling the shots in my life. Much as it chagrins me, I'm of the mind that perhaps it would be best if we stopped all communication and no longer got together. It's just too hard. I spend a bit of time with you and I'm on a high for a few days and then it can be weeks or months before I hear from you again. It's just not what I want. Don't get me wrong - I KNOW what we have and share together is special and unique ( at least I believe it is) and I will probably always love you, but I just can't do this anymore. I know you visit this site, so you may or may not see this or even recognise yourself. If the shoe fits and you feel like responding I will be here..."

I don't know if you had a ring, since your mitts were keeping your hands warmI was the tall bearded guy in a scarf and sunglasses. I never introduced myself before I was pulled away by my mate, and he apologized after not seeing that i was trying to keep your attention. I went back to where I thought I'd see you again in the 4th, but alas.. she was gone.I have no idea how this works, but I guess its my only option at this point since I won't get to see you until next season.. BUT if you happen to read this for kicks like I do.. maybe you don't have plans yet for the Grey Cup...-Sleepless in the Southside"

But it won't work-you don't know the half of my story and never asked.I hope in the future, you can look back and see that every action was done with the intention of love....And anyone who reads this who's heart is breaking and feels like it's dying like mine is-you aren't alone. Everything will make sense in the end, I promise you."

winter,Ottawa-Hull-Gatineau,m4w,Such a shame - m4w,"I was nothing for you but someone to toy with. You fall for the bottom feeders, not knowing your worth, and once they are done with you, you crush the one that loves you. Did you enjoy toying with my feelings? Did it make you feel better about yourself? Knowing that someone wants you, but because of your own issues, you couldn't see their worth or yours, and thought it okay to play with their heart? I thought I felt sorry for myself, but truly it is you who I feel sorry for. Fix up yourself, and stop being a coward so you don't destroy the next person who might actually give a damn about you!"

You are funny, confident and it is clear that you are a social butterfly. I'm not in the lifestyle and my boyfriend would never consider it because he's incredibly insecure and jealous so this is not to hit on you. Just know that serving you drinks was my pleasure. Hearing you talk about your experiences got me so dripping wet I had to take care of myself when I got home. I wish there were more guys like you on this planet.

winter,Ottawa-Hull-Gatineau,w4m,A Crooked Smile - w4m,"I'm writing this here knowing you will probably never read it. Knowing you stopped wanting to hear from me a long time ago. I wish, at the time, I had understood the depth of your indifference. I wish that I could just move on and find a way to live with your silence. I've always been on the outside looking in, and before you came into my life I was quite obliviously content living that way. It wasn't until I saw myself through your stupid blue eyes that I realized how shallow my life had been. I've only ever had my words and an unnatural ability to wield them into sentiment, but I know that there are no words, in this language or another that would bring you back to me. That would make you understand exactly what you meant to me and how much it rattled my life. Forget for a second that I fell madly in love with you, forget that deep down you believe I loved you untruly. You gave me a space where I felt understood. My dark and cynical thoughts would spark long conversations between us, not irritation and avoidance. Sometimes you would laugh at my ire, like you knew how it felt to be helpless in anger. Our impotent rage -- I've never been able to share that kind of pessimism with anyone. We've always seen the world through the same sad eyes and I miss my like-minded companion. There were differences, to be sure. Maybe insurmountably so. But I bonded with you in a way that I am sure I will never find again. In a way that I hope you have found in another. No matter how many years pass in silence between us, I will always ache for our friendship. You just never understood how much belonging somewhere meant to me. It's like there's a grand party. Everyone who is anyone is there, the music is playing and everyone's dancing. I'm just outside on the porch. I'm alone in the dark and I've been there for 28 years. Their laughter drowns out my knocking and no one comes to answer. But there was a boy once, with a crooked smile and a dark soul. He sat down beside me and said the party was lame. For a fleeting moment, we made beautiful poetry together -- on the steps of that porch. It's quite simple and so desperately human -- I will never forget you."

I only want to let you know that I thought you were VERY adorable and cute, and I liked the energy that you were giving off. So I know it's you, let me know what you told me about upstairs and downstairs, and what was the first thing you drinking [only because I was only there ever so briefly]Cheers"
winter,Ottawa-Hull-Gatineau,m4w,Whisky girl - m4w,"God, I never post on these things, but feel compelled. You were serving a new product and I was a lucky customer.

It was a joke, but I think you took it too seriously, and I was drunk and was acting like an idiot. Anyways I've changed a lot in the last year, not long after you left I was in a serious relationship for a long time and that ended recently.

winter,Montreal,m4w,Mile End girl <3 - m4w,"Every era has its time and today, now, is the era of the Mile End girl.What defines the Mile End girl? That's tricky. You see, much like an intricate work of art spawnedat 4:17am on the day of the equinox, the Mile End girl is unequivocally eclectic and...undefinable.The last thing that you want to do is to label the Mile End girl. Like, don't even try. First of all, a Mile End girl does not have to be anything or anyone in particular. My findings point more towards a fluidstate of consciousness that overlaps and shifts from one dominant perspective to a different one,yet always well rooted on sound grounds. This state of consciousness seems to imbibe the ""girl in question"" regardless of geographical location.Yes, you heard me; a Mile End girl could be anywhere on the globe. Perhaps the only characteristic that could be said to be consistent, is the fashion sense the Mile End girl skillfully applies. Givenchy with an old pair of cracking Doc Martins? No problem. Tshirt under a fur coat? Regular attire for dep runs. High heels, sweat pants and blouse? Yep. Hockey shirt and pearl necklace? Done. You know what I mean?I could go on and on, but you know who you are and why you're awesome."

winter,Montreal,m4m,Bubble Butt at YMCA du Parc - m4m,"I fell in love with your ass at YMCA du parc. I started on the elliptical in the middle, and then you walked in and caught my eye with that unusual 80s gold digital watch and I couldn't keep my eyes off you. You didn't see me but after putting on your black headband, you decided to run on the treadmill directly in front of me where I could watch that ass bounce from behind and from the mirror on the side for a sweet twenty minutes! It was like a dream, I was hard pretty much the whole time, your ass is perfect, I don't think I've ever worked out so hard in my life, thank you. I finished the cardio and I did some some squats and pullups ...then I got really into my workout and forgot about you while I finished up and went to stretch.BUT THEN just as I was stretching you appeared out of no where and dropped down right next to me on the matts and started stretching even though the rest were empty. Jesus christ. I was shaking already I was so turned on watching you stretch, and then you flipped over on your stomach, pointed that ass right at me and started doing the stretch like number 13 in the photo. I don't know what the stretch is called, but I was hypnotized. I couldn't even think, I didn't want to be rude, but ...I couldn't take my eyes off of you and I almost fell over because I lost balance. I got a hardon, and then we started exchanging glances and I think I saw you get hard too when you turned onto your back again and faced me. Thankfully no one was around. Really the whole thing felt surreal, and I wanted to talk to you but I didn't know what to say.You're beautiful! I had a black shirt and shorts and a buzzcut....I woke up this morning with a hardon and you on my mind. Thank you!"

winter,Montreal,m4w,Life is strange... - m4w,"...sometimes you get flashbacks of people smiling, or doing something, or just being. You don't know why, but those moments stay with you, and have profound meaning.Sometimes you don't even know them, and the flashbacks were from the few seconds that they were in your life.Still, sometimes people just leave an impression.I want to list a few of them - that when I think about, only leaves me with feelings of love.I didn't necessarily miss a connection with them, but more like... a connection was made. Connections don't come with any guarantees, or expiry dates. These are some people who have somehow affected me at my heart, throughout my life here on Earth... and I hope that I will never forget them, because they taught me so much - many of them without saying even a word, and some of them without ever having made eye-contact with me; but all I feel in my heart for them, is love, and if I could, I would hug each and every one of them for as long as they needed - no, I'm not offering a ""cuddle-service"", like some exploitative women on this site. This isn't about money; also, it isn't in any hope that any of them might recognize their description, and contact me. It's just a feeling I am having, and I wanted to share - to get it out there somehow. Well, here they are (in no particular order):- Tess (the only one I'll mention by name). I think you're beautiful. We share so much in common - particularly our pasts (although we never met), trials, troubles, tribulations & struggles. You keep me strong and give me hope that love is still possible, even from great distances. I love you.- There was a boy I saw at Zellers (remember that place?) once... he must have been a teen, but was mentally challenged (I don't mean it disparagingly - I just don't know how else to say it). He had this smile on his face, even though his life wasn't perfect. He walked strangely - at the ankle-joint, with his feet twisted inwards (adduction), and he was wearing cargo pants plus cargo jacket, with so many pockets everywhere. His lesson was twofold; that we can't take everything with us, and that it's good to be prepared. I love you.- Similarly, a girl who was also mentally challenged. This memory is a little more vague. I think it was during Zellers' closing week. I don't remember, but everyone was running crazily to grab liquidating items, but she wasn't. She looked at me and smiled in a way I can't define. It was like a gentle, warm hug, and there was more, but I can't remember - I wish I could (I'll update this if I do). Anyway, I love you.- The was a girl at Value Village once, there with her friends. Talking, smiling. I don't remember if she looked at me, but I couldn't stop gazing at her eyes. They were the most vulnerable eyes I had (and have) ever seen - and along with the way she moved and carried herself, revealing how scared, insecure & sensitive she was - as though she was hurt(ing?) and no one would understand, so she pretended otherwise ( - think ""complete opposite of self-assured & confident""), and I just thought to myself how brave she was to be out there in this world. I couldn't stop looking back at her. I thought she was beautiful, although I remember little else of her physique - I think she had dark hair, but those blue sparkling eyes I'll never forget - they reflected many of the pains I myself have endured. The lesson: no matter how scared you are, and sensitive; it's okay - you're not alone. I love you.- There was a woman who came to a yard sale I was hosting... she came in the middle, when no one else was around, stayed a while, and left before anyone else arrived. She kept complimenting on what a nice yard sale it was, when all I saw was a bunch of junk scattered around the yard - that I had earlier placed there one by one (while my ex-gf - who had left me alone to man her yard-sale, was being a particularly impatient & ungrateful). This woman was incredibly nice in contrast, and insisted it was a very nice yard sale, as though she was admiring paintings at a museum. She seemed disheveled and had little money, and she offered some worn packets of tea, as currency. I let her have an alarm clock she was fixated on. Anyway, she was the nicest person ever, and taught me a level of appreciation toward the work that people do in order to set things up and organize them - a huge theme of my life, that had been pretty much thankless up to that point. Also, she taught me that a little appreciation goes a long way - and so a lot goes even further. I love you.- There was a man who seemed distressed. He walked straight toward me on the sidewalk, and somehow got my attention. He was mid 40's - I'd say, and a little gaunt, and he was crying. I stopped and listened to whatever he had to say. I don't remember how the conversation started, but I remember I was having a particularly bad day because of something unfair that had just happened to me - I was a walking head down with a bit of a heavy heart, angry at how I was treated. Well apparently, my day wasn't as bad as his; he told me his wife (or significant other) had left him - or rather, kicked him out, if I remember, and he was devastated; had no idea what to do. Neither did I, seeing that I never had a relationship at that point, but I felt compassion for him. He spoke French, and I'm Anglo, but the story was said in his eyes. I felt so sorry for him - he seemed like a man who would definitely not abuse his woman. I didn't know how I could help him, so I gave him some food I had in my backpack - a Nutri-Grain bar, and maybe an apple, or an orange - I think. He seemed to become a little less terrified after he could talk to me, but I think he just realized that I was not equipped to handle his situation - even though I tried, & wished that I could. He taught me that compassion is universal, and that language doesn't matter; also, no matter how shitty you think you have it, there is always worse. I love you, and although you may have felt broken, useless, outcast... I knew that there was love in your heart (meaning that you are very far from useless, or broken) - or else it wouldn't have hurt so much.- A young lady, with a deformed/humped back - not sure what the condition is called; she couldn't walk straight (or maybe I'm wrong), was waiting in a line with her mother. She seemed a little unsure of herself. Didn't look at me, but it felt like she thought she might be a burden, sad that she might not find someone to love her... you're not a burden, and you don't deserve to be thought of any less than others. I love you.- There was a man once, on the bus. He looked vagrant and unkempt. He was fumbling with batteries for his portable CD-player (this was fairly recent). He tried a number of them - without the results he seemed hoping for, and a couple fell from his hands (or hole in his plastic bag?), but nobody helped him pick them up. At the terminus, he immediately went for a garbage can, and started rummaging through it. Everyone walked by him; not me. I stopped and handed him a fiver - I said he could use it for new batteries; I figured his life was already shit, and now he had no music! He was surprised and started talking to me, and I patiently listened. He thanks me, and I shook his hand, and at the same time, gave him a half-hug. He taught me that sometimes we just need someone to pay us a little attention, and to treat us with dignity & respect. I love you.- There was a hill I climbed during one winter - as a shortcut; it was covered w/ very slippery snow, rather steep. A mother followed, and she made it. Her daughter was still below, struggling. She slipped once (I think), looked up, and had a worried look in her eyes that she knew she wouldn't make it, and for some reason, it felt like that meant she would never be with her mother again (I know, it sounds strange). I planted my feet and extended my hand, and she took it. I pulled her up, without any words exchanged, and they both smiled, maybe said 'thank you' - but the words didn't matter. The lesson is that we can't always make it on our own; we need each other, to work together, if we are to survive, and that it's okay to ask for help, just like it's okay to help others without them having to ask first. I love you.- There was a girl at a barter fair. She was very sweet to me. I'm not sure but it felt like she was testing (by trusting me), whether she felt safe with me. When her dad (or ""owner""? - you never know at these things) saw her talking to me, he quickly called her into their massive, custom, 18-wheeler style truck / RV (this was in the States - things are bigger there). She taught me that trust is easier than people make it out to be. I hope you are safe & well. I love you.- A young adult with heavy mental difficulty (probably quite autistic) was at a ""Dfi Sportif"", and she was being constantly supervised. I think she was in a wheelchair, but I remember she had a unicorn, or some sort of toy horse, that was reassuring to her - like a security blanket or childhood stuffed animal; well, this was a hard-plastic unicorn, pink and white, from what I remember. She was kissing it a lot. I'm glad she had such caring & patient social-worker(s), who treated her kindly, and with respect - but this isn't about them. The lesson is that no matter who you are, or what you struggle with, the need for love cannot escape us. I love you, and wish you feel loved for the rest of your life.- One time, I was at a Halloween party, and was feeling very awkward without a costume, wearing my leather coat that was one size too large for me. I had cut my hair that day - myself, from about shoulder length, to something less (I don't remember) - but I'm sure it looked awful. Anyway, I wanted to vanish into a wall, but one girl - she was deaf; kept me company. She was very pretty and had made her own costume - with real fabrics. I don't remember what it was - I was shy, and didn't want to look her up and down. Anyway, she approached and talked to me at a low point; normally when people want nothing to do with you... not her - she didn't judge me in the slightest; she was so friendly and amiable - she was an angel. I wish I could thank her - to tell her how awesome she is. The lesson is that everyone needs love, and we shouldn't be quick to judge people. I love you.The ultimate lesson here - although thankfully, there are exceptions; is that people who have nothing ""wrong"" with them, and are ""perfectly"" functional - or completely confident & capable, tend to be self-centered assholes; whereas those with no egos, many challenges and difficulties in life, seem to have the most soul - and the most love & kindness in their hearts; which is worth so much more than climbing up in social status, striving to ""succeed"", chasing material wealth, and accumulating money.One more thing - perhaps I should have prefaced with this: I myself am challenged, and have struggled with mild autism, atop a few other things... Many of these encounters was when words were mostly jumbled to me - verbal communication was a barrier, and I primarily experienced & understood the world through feelings & emotions. I still get scared sometimes, and overwhelmed by it all, and I don't know where I'd be without people who believed in me, have had love for me, acceptance, and patience.Maybe the meaning of all of is that there is hope for humanity - or that I sure wish so. With so much violence and brutality, racism and prejudice, religion and divide, hatred and disrespect, I wish people would realize that we are all human - and that we all need love, the next time they are about to break someone's heart, dump and/or reject someone, before they decapitate someone (literally), pull the trigger of a gun, ruin someone's life, make threats, offer ultimatums, or plan out any sort of terror. Because one day, money will cease to have any value, and you won't be able to buy even food with it - mark my words; when that day comes, you will realize your folly to have placed it over & above good connections, or potential (priceless, life-altering & life-promoting) connections that you so easily snubbed, dismissed.If there are any more that come to mind, I will come back and add them.I love you all."

winter,Montreal,m4ww,RE: Advice - w4mm - m4ww,"Great piece of advice for us all. Nonetheless, in most cases it simply means that, for whatever reason, he wasn't ready for a relationship with YOU; maybe he sensed that you were holding back and weren't fully invested in your liaison. If he actually wasn't ready for a relationship, then you're better off without him since he's most likely a commitaphobe.My advice? When you've found someone you really like, jump in with both feet, show them that you're fully involved in what you two have and stop rationalizing about every little detail; no matter how cheesy or cliche this sounds, love is about feelings and much less about ration.I have met way too many women longing for the one who got away.:)"

Just because you throw out a line doesn't mean you're guaranteed to get a bite. Think you're a gambler and you played the odds...just that simple.M.G - I have no interest in going to a ""proper dating site"". I'm on missed connection because I'm trying to connect with one specific person that I'm already interested in; not interested in going to a dating site in hopes of finding someone else. What's with the name calling in your email anyway? Bully anyone lately??M - I'm neither a troll nor hairy. Why so jaded? Sometimes people really don't have an ulterior motive.P.R - Under other circumstances or another time, I would have given it a shot in return. But, I'm here in hopes that that one specific guy reads my original post ( the prequel post to ""kudos to men""). Thanks.F.B & S,A - Simply put, thank you and you are welcome.R - Thanks for your kind wordsT.L - I think for the most part people come to missed connection hoping that maybe this time they will be the one that someone is crushing on. Some of us still believe in romance and being wooed."

winter,Montreal,w4m,RE : Kudos to men - w4m,"After having my ""Kudos to men"" post up for 30 minutes, I got a reply to the tone of anonymous adventurous play. And while that may very be welcomed by some, that was not the intent of my post. There was no sub-text; I won't be taking you up on the offer. First instinct ...take it down - they'll be more of the same to come. I struggled at little with reason but I keep the ad up just the same.Three hours later, different email, different tone. Tone of pent up anger ( or maybe I am mistaken and it is pain) and disbelief that a woman could be considerate enough to write such a post. I do not know how to make you believe it, but alas, there are ever so many considerate woman among us cross the world over. The world is filled with considerate woman and men alike. My wish for you is that when you next come across a considerate woman you recognize her for all the she is, holds and offers to share. I wish you happiness and that in time a gentle heart comes your way and softens you - that together you live out the love story of your dreams.The only reason I didn't pull down the ad faster than I could wish it down, is cause I know there to be countless great guys out there who are willing to be who they are - romantic and sincere. Who know, really know, how to be romantic and sincere. These guys follow no play book nor guideline but rather their own authentic romantic tune.And maybe one of these great guys is having a shit day today and is just looking for a little something to keep him believing in love and romance a little longer 'till he finds it to call his own. Maybe on this shit day, he might come across such a post and have it affirm his belief that woman are drawn to and fall in love with men who are secure in themselves to share and display their softer side. To know that there are woman that yearn for it. Maybe some great guy is just reading the posts for fun and will appreciate being recognized and admired for being such a sentimental guy.It's for these very same ""maybe scenarios"" that in writing this last post that I've decided to keep the original up."

winter,Montreal,w4mw,kudos to men :o) - w4mw,"While Missed Connections has its share of creepy, perverty and angry males, the replies to my post lead me to say that the balance is definitely tipped in favor of the romantic, well expressed , thoughtful, honest and witty men.Tattoos may be hot but wearing your heart on your sleeve can be that much more. Kudos to these men and the countless kindred spirits!Yes ladies this small sample pool reminds me that there are some pretty fine men in our fair city. When we come across one, let's be up for the unexpected, the unknown, the possibility and give them a chance.Now as for the fellas, I hope the replies are indicative of your true essence and what you put out to women; I hope this is part of you that you actually share .

I won't ask you what she did, that's for you to tell if and when...I will ask you though, if you can, to free your mind of it for a little while and just let yourself be - to look up and see what's here for you to see. I hope that maybe if you do this, you'll be able to see...me.Do you see what can be? Do you see that your scar makes it hard for me? Do you see that a scar is more than a reminder?

If you take it though, I'll dance with you, I'll walk with you, I'll laugh with you and yes I'll even cry with you.Look up and out and hopefully you'll see me 'coz I've tried what I've tried and I'm not sure that you do. See that you do something to me. See that you're a more than just a man with a scar."

Shortly thereafter, we hooked up at my place on a Sunday and had a great time, but unfortunately we lost contact. It was my impression you really liked me since you came extremely hard when I went down on you, and you also deep-throated me like a champ, practically insisting that I give you a second load which I did. Honestly, those were two of the best blow jobs I've ever had (definitely the best of 2014), and I still get hard just thinking about that look of happiness and excitement in your eyes as I climaxed and fed you my delicious protein shakes. What were your exact words again before giving me those seductive smirks? ""Good to the last drop"" and ""I knew I could get a second one out of you"". Yeah... Good times indeed. No, correct that... The BEST of times :)Anyways, I tried texitng you a couple times in the weeks that followed to see how you were, but I never got a response, and once I finally decided to call I realized your number was no longer in service. As you can imagine I was quite surprised and disappointed since you gave me the impression you wanted to hook up again.Hopefully you still read ads here because I'd really like to see and host you again!Please find this message in a bottle!"

I don't envision you in a sexy dress that reveals just the right amount of naughtiness. I don't fantasize about us having ravishing deliberate satiable and unparalleled passion. I do however, imagine your smile and face, and sometimes you're standing and sometimes there's trees; all the while, I'm usually watching something with my girlfriend. I definitely like you, and maybe I like you a lot and perhaps it's more fantasy and for not. I want you to know that I am unconventional and perhaps I do fit neatly in certain boxes but when it comes to romance...Who am I kidding I'm not conventional about a whole lot of things:P The thing about the universe universe is, the law of attraction, manifestation and as you seem to have figured out, is that you are always intending.

winter,Saskatoon,m4w,"Incredible beauty, Saskatoon Transit, bus route 3 - m4w","Any one reading this, feel free to post my story anywhere and everywhere on social media. The more it's out there the better chance I'll find her. Thanks.I saw you on the city bus yeasterday.I was wearing a blue-striped short sleeve button up and jeans. You were wearing a vintage red skirt and a smart white blouse. You got on at Place Reil on campus and sat across from me and we made eye contact, briefly. I fell in love with you a little bit, in that stupid way where you completely make up a fictional version of the person you're looking at and fall in love with that person. Several times we looked at each other and then looked away. I tried to think of something to say to you -- maybe pretend I didn't know where I was going and ask you for directions or say something nice about your earrings, or just say, ""Hot day."" It all seemed so stupid.At one point, I caught you staring at me and you immediately averted your eyes. You pulled a book out of your bag and started reading it -- a biography of Candy Darling- but I noticed you never once turned a page.My stop was on McKercher I decided to stay on, rationalizing that I could just get off after the bus went all around East College Park and back on McKercher off of DeGeer, but then I didn't get off after DeGeer either. You must have missed your stop as well, because when we got all the way to the end of the line at the Center Mall, we both just sat there in the bus, waiting.I cocked my head at you inquisitively. You shrugged and held up your book as if that was the reason.Still I said nothing.We took the bus all the way back down -- down Acadia thru Wildwood around Boychuck back down McKercher to Sutherland, down 108 th back to the University and thru to Down town. I knew I had to say something.Still I said nothing.And so we went back up.Back up the Number 3 bus route. We caught the rush hour crowds down town and then saw them thin out again at the end of the line at Center mall again. I gave myself deadlines: I'll talk to her before we cross the river,I'll talk to her before we get back on campus. Still I remained silent.I kept waiting for that tiny gesture could have been enough to pivot us into a conversation, but there in stupid silence still we sat.There were times when we were the only two souls on the bus and even then I felt self-conscious about bothering you. She's reading her book, I thought, she doesn't want to talk to me. Still, there were moments when I felt a connection. Someone would shout something crazy about Jesus and we'd immediately look at each other to register our reactions. A couple of teenagers would exit, holding hands, and we'd both think: Young Love.For hours we sat on that bus, just barely pretending not to notice each other. I got to know you so well, if only peripherally. I memorized the curves of your body, the contours of your face, the patterns of your breath. Eventually you stood up as the bus pulled up to 8th St on Acadia. You hesitated briefly there, perhaps waiting for me to say something, giving me one last chance to stop you, but rather than spit out hours of suppressed almost-conversations I said nothing, and I watched you slip out between the closing doors.It took me a few more stops before I realized you were really gone. I kept waiting for you to reenter the bus sit down next to me, grab my hand and rest your head on my shoulder.When the bus returned to 8th street from the mall, I craned my neck as we passed where you got off. Perhaps you were there, At the stop,still waiting. Perhaps I would see you, smiling and bright, your hair waving in the wind.But no, you were gone. And I realized most likely I would never see you again. And I thought about how amazing it was to spend that entire afternoon with you, knowing for those hours we were both so filled with anticipation we could have burst. Well at least I was.Thank you for that afternoon, for the rest of my days I will think of you ,I will think of how I felt and how the intensity grew to a want I've never felt so strong before , who knows if I will ever feel again.If by chance you happen to read this, you can find me out in Saskatoon on weekend nights watching live music. There is a 99% chance of running into me if the band Gong Show is performing in town."

winter,Vancouver,m4m,Intense eye contact at Superstore - Metrotown - m4m,"I was buying some nuts in the bulk section at superstore when you walked bye. We kept looking at each other for a while. You were a young-looking white guy who was shopping with an older man (not sure if that was your dad or your bf). I wanted to say ""hi"" but I wasn't sure if you were with your partner. I'm very sure you were interested in me tho. If you see this, please send me an email and tell me what I looked like or were wearing so I know it's you. It would be lovely to get to know you. :)Hint: I carried an umbrella."
winter,Vancouver,m4m,N19 downtown to Surrey Central - m4m,"You are the white guy who sat in front of me with headphones on. I was intrigued by your bubbly attitude when you got on the bus, but was too shy to say ""hi"" as I wasn't sure if you are into guys. We both got off at Surrey Central and as soon as you got in a cab, I knocked on it and asked where you were heading. Too bad we weren't heading the same direction... At least I tried.You seem like a cool guy. I would love to get to know you more. Please reply if you see this.You were heading to Newton area."
winter,Vancouver,m4w,hwy 1 360 dec 3 - m4w,You were cut off by a chevy on hwy 1. Your brakes locked up and your blue car did 2 360's spin out. You were facing head on traffic when you finally stopped. I was the only one to stop and help. I stopped the fast lane and the HOV lane with my truck during morning rush hour traffic so you could get to safety. It was too dangerous for us to talk much on the hwy. I only gave you a quick hug and we were on our way. I always think about that moment. Just thought I would take a chance and see if maybe you read these posts. I dont know how else to find you...
winter,Vancouver,m4m,YMCA-Downtown 9pmish (nov.5) - m4m,"I am not sure why i am posting this but somehow i feel compelled to do so. I haven't seen you at the YMCA downtown for a while.

winter,Vancouver,m4w,you and two little kids near fraser 26th - m4w,"Hey I was working nearby Fraser and 26th on Dec 3rd when you were walking with two little kids :) in blue top or hoodie.There was movie or some kinda shooting happening.Would like to see u today if your free :)"
winter,Vancouver,m4w,Saw you on the SkyTrain - m4w,"I saw you on the SkyTrain. I was wearing a Canucks 12 (Smyl) jersey and jeans. You were wearing a conventional West-coast assortment of lightly-branded yoga attire with a fair bit of pink and gray. We both wore glasses. I guess we still do.You got on at Granville and sat across from me and we made eye contact, briefly. I fell in love with you a little bit, in that stupid way where you completely make up a fictional version of the person you're looking at and fall in love with that person. But still I think there was something there.Several times we looked at each other and then looked away. I tried to think of something to say to you -- maybe pretend I didn't know where I was going and ask you for directions or say something nice about your maple-leaf-shaped earrings, or just say, ""Rainy day."" It all seemed so stupid.At one point, I caught you staring at me and you immediately averted your eyes. You pulled a book out of your bag and started reading it -- a biography of John Diefenbaker -- but I noticed you never once turned a page.My stop was Royal Oak, but when we got there, I decided to stay on, rationalizing that I could just as easily transfer from New West onto some bus, but then I didn't get off in New West either. You must have missed your stop as well, because we both stayed on, over the bridge into Surrey, all the way to the end.When we got to King George, we both just sat there in the car, waiting.I cocked my head at you inquisitively. You shrugged and held up your book as if that was the reason.Still I said nothing.We took the train all the way back down -- down past Edmonds, down past Commercial, back under downtown, all the way to Waterfront. And when we got to Waterfront, I knew I had to say something.Still I said nothing.And so we went back up.Up and down the Expo line, over and over. We caught the rush hour crowds and then saw them thin out again. We watched the sun set over English Bay as we passed between Science World and Stadium. I gave myself deadlines: I'll talk to her before Burrard; I'll talk to her after 22nd Ave, when we're over that cemetery. Still I remained silent.For months we sat on the train saying nothing to each other. We survived on bags of skittles and Kit-Kats sold to us by kids raising money for their hockey teams. We must have heard a million buskers, had our faces nearly kicked in by a hundred strung-out freaks. I gave money to the beggars until I ran out of loonies and twonies. When the train went above ground I'd get text messages and voicemails (""Where are you? What happened? Are you okay?"") until my phone ran out of battery.I'll talk to her before daybreak; I'll talk to her before Tuesday. The longer I waited, the harder it got. What could I possibly say to you now, now that we've passed this same station for the hundredth time? I would kick myself for days after every time you sneezed -- why hadn't I said ""Bless You""? That tiny gesture could have been enough to pivot us into a conversation, but here in stupid silence still we sat.There were nights when we were the only two souls in the car, perhaps even on the whole train, and even then I felt self-conscious about bothering you. She's reading her book, I thought, she doesn't want to talk to me. Still, there were moments when I felt a connection. Someone would shout something crazy about Gregor and we'd immediately look at each other to register our reactions. A couple of teenagers would exit, holding hands, and we'd both think: Young Love.For thirty years, we sat in that car, just barely pretending not to notice each other. I got to know you so well, if only peripherally. I memorized the folds of your body, the contours of your face, the patterns of your breath. I saw you cry once after you'd glanced at a neighbour's Province newspaper. I wondered if you were crying about something specific, or just the general passage of time, so unnoticeable until suddenly noticeable. I wanted to comfort you, wrap my arms around you, assure you I knew everything would be fine, but it felt too familiar; I stayed glued to my seat.One day, in the middle of the afternoon, you stood up as the train pulled into Metrotown. It was difficult for you, this simple task of standing up, since you hadn't done it in thirty years. Holding onto the rails, you managed to get yourself to the door. You hesitated briefly there, perhaps waiting for me to say something, giving me one last chance to stop you, but rather than spit out a lifetime of suppressed almost-conversations I said nothing, and I watched you slip out between the closing sliding doors.It took me a few more stops before I realized you were really gone. I kept waiting for you to reenter the train, sit down next to me, rest your head on my shoulder. Nothing would be said. Nothing would need to be said.When the train returned to Metrotown, I craned my neck as we entered the station. Perhaps you were there, on the platform, still waiting. Perhaps I would see you, smiling and bright, your long gray hair waving in the wind from the oncoming train.But no, you were gone. And I realized most likely I would never see you again. And I thought about how amazing it is that you can know somebody for thirty years and yet still not really know that person at all.I stayed on the train until it got to Nanaimo, at which time I got off and found a cab.(ty and kudos - RaphaelBW)"

winter,Vancouver,m4w,"Re Random Glances , manning up discussion - m4w","Well said (last post)There are hot women and beautiful women The beautiful ones are always takenThe hot ones are usually bitchesThe difference is the attitude which is brought on by bad upbringing and losers that spoil these types of women Like I said: The beautiful ones are usually taken"
winter,Vancouver,m4w,Re: Re: Random Glances.... - w4m - m4w,"I think you have some valid points. It's a fact that the most beautiful women are approached the least. Bitterness may have something to do with it but... We live in a culture where feminism is inadvertently suppressing male initiative when it comes to dating. If we approach a woman and she's not into it, we're creeps (the feminist reaction is that we label her a bitch). We need to walk a tightrope of ""male privilege"" but still ""man up"". Masculine traits that women find desirable are also those that contribute to what makes us the target of (sometimes justifiably) attacks and labels. I put it to you that in a world where we are striving for equality for all genders (but with different expectations for each) that it may be time for women to take more of an initiative. If you catch a cute guy making eyes, why don't you approach him? Flex your feminist muscles and show him how you are a strong, confident woman. We will never complain about that I assure you. In a world where we are constantly told to ""man up"" one moment and then shamed with male privilege and stories of outliers who are dickbags (honestly couldn't think of a better adjective) ie Dan Bizerian or whatever that idiot's name is... We get just as confused as you do. Maybe just maybe think that we leave you alone because that's what we are being taught is the polite thing to do."

I can't believe I didn't think what we had was enough. Since I fucked up and you left, I realize that what we had is all people want to find. It's all I ever wanted and I have no idea how we thought what we had may not have been it.I've done this to myself. I've done this to you. You said I was stupid but you know I'm not. I immediately regretted what I did; what I let happen. I didn't want it to be real. I wanted it to somehow just be some fucked up delusion that never happened. I didn't want to hide it from you but I didn't want to lose you. I couldn't. I felt like if I could just have one last day with you; one last night with you, it was worth it to not tell you. I was selfish. I still wouldn't change having one last night with you which is terrible of me. I should have been honest. I should have told you so you didn't have to spend that night with a cheater. . . The consequence of this mistake is well deserved but beyond what I was willing to deal with. I am truly sorry I've put myself before you when you are the victim of my choices. Please know I am sorry. Not for myself, not because I miss you. I'm sorry for having you trust me and love me and care about me and invest in me and for me to hurt you. I'm so sorry. Just know I regret what I did every day. You are an amazing person, a great man. I deserve to lose you and you deserve so much better than me. I am just so fucking sorry I did this to you. Sorry doesn't change anything but at least you can know that for the rest of my life I will regret what I did to you. I love you and I am sorry. Thank you for an amazing life and helping me become a way better person than when we met."

The only way we would see each other is as usual. A random encounter. That is the way as always, you need to have that control which has also been part of the issue. Me communicating over run by emotion rather than conscious thought also a huge factor. There was a lot you kept secret from me that continued to hurt as it was revealed. What is your say? Please ""No its all lies and didn't happen"" is not the truth."

A miss communication I guess."

winter,Vancouver,m4w,Wasted Love - m4w,"Chris,I sit here alone frustrated over what did not happen. We both knew what the situation is, we're in our 40s, we're both not looking for serious relationships and we wanted to forget the dating and courtship BS to just have the passion not commitment. We talked about being together for hours touching, kissing, holding each other in a warm bed until every part of us was taken care of. We'd write emails to each other tell each other how much we wanted to be with each other, how much we wanted this and how much we wanted each other. You were a sweet lady in public but you wanted me to fuck you fuck you like you were a whore. You knew I can give you what you want when we did get together...remember that one Friday night...perfect!I believed you when you wanted me as much as I wanted you but you started to make every excuse to not want it. You were always too busy to meet, you had a work thing to take care of. I do not know what your game was but to me, I wasted energy and I'm sad because it could have been so damn good. I know you'll read this. If you do not want that passion then some other woman that reads this will. You need to be true to what you say and not run and hide when things are not going your way. I wasted love on you and I won't let that happen again."

winter,Vancouver,m4w,God I'm Glad That Didn't Happen - m4w,"Even after she slept with a few of my now former friends, lied, stole from me, attempted to have me beat up I still longed for her, and dreamed of her every night. I felt worthless without her. Looking back at it I laugh at how stupid I was, hindsight is always 20/20. But back then I thought I couldn't go on without her. I have to thank her for turning my heart to stone, no one gets in even if the relationship lasts a long time, and I'm totally alright with that. The joy of getting older is how well we deal with disappointment. Anyone going through a break-up right now, don't dwell on it too much. Have your couple days of mourning for the death of the connection and move on. And If you're with someone right now, if you have even half a doubt about your partner GET OUT!!!! Sadness, stress, and worry will kill you faster than drugs and disease. I never want to see any of my EXs ever again, just like shit down a toilet."

winter,Vancouver,m4w,e zeek ial 25:17 - m4w,"I wonder if the bible is actually a baiting technique used to exposed the true evil in people, the people who are willing yo prey on the needy, and emotionally equipped, internally weak, aswell as the wretched and maniacal.you see its oftern those who claim gold seal performance, who use the doctrines and gospel to manipulate and justify their selfish actions, serve their purpose. And then when it turns on them they fall back on it aswell and use it to claim victim status and turn to it for more guidance. The most evil are exposed often when only the true power and oppourtunity presents its self. A little theory for those who are religious pursercutionists, to ponder as they use baiting and gaslighting to manipulate and their served outcomes. What if the whole story is true. What it every person lives the book in one way or another. The book as I interpret is a guide to seek inner peace and projectify true good and peace to EVERYONE else . Not serve as a fused manipulation for the evil narcisists to disguise as sheep and take from those who are truly willing to give it anyway. To the wretched swine in the world who think this mabe for them, its not, we can't change what's written, you know that. This is for the few who have weathered the evil tyranical hatred of those who say their next to god in their evil self serving relious costumes of perfect self idealistic personifications of good. The ones who willingly continue to gi ve to those who willing take. When we hear you saying love,love,love, we are hearimg your lies,lies,lies, and that we see in you enchanting eyes. So it the gut feeling in which I truly rely, just to get me by what of its the few Wo survive and the masses who die Remember at one time nobody believed him either."

winter,Vancouver,m4w,Re: MW - m4w,"A mature man doesn't slap a woman's post down. To prop himself up and feed his own ego. He's out having a good time with his date last night (like my date last night) and is too engaged in life to result to bitter school boy behaviour. Real men give and don't complainIf I were you, I wouldn't criticize a song by an artist who broke international world records for sales in the last month. Clearly, her words resonate with many.

winter,Vancouver,w4m,Jacob - w4m,"you were a secret treasure I couldn't share with anyone that mattered.. all those moments hidden away safe in a lock box of memories that no one will ever find. You were a secret that knew all of mine. At least when we were in contact it was like I could share it with you even if we didn't talk about anything worthwhile. I don't think I ever did anything malicious to you to deserve what you did. It could have been the start of something fun and stimulating but instead I had to put it away and forget it. I was made to be ashamed of something I was so excited to embrace with you. Whatever I did to you to deserve that, I don't know but you made me feel beyond the lowest and most disrespected. Probably because I actually did care about you and held hope in some kind of friendship that clearly never existed even after 2 years playing together.You were my first for many but you were never there when I really needed you. Some of the things you said stand out flashing in my mind like a neon sign ""We won't know each other forever"", ""you should go be with other people"". I thought I was prepared. I dealt the best I could. Still, your ""honesty"" in a lot of ways made me trust you more than others. I respected the truth and straightforwardness, you meant so much more to me than any others because of it. Despite the messed up treatment that I apparently craved and miss, you really were one of the most important people to me. Even if in the end I meant nothing to you, you will always be precious to me. I can't fully forget, my subconscious wont even let me.I've had plenty of dreams now and for that brief moment before the sweet land of whimsy drifts away, I wake up feeling satisfied to have seen you. In my most recent dream we were outside. I was bartending at an outdoor event. You came up behind me on purpose for a surprise. After the shock of seeing you passed, you sat down with your back against a cement wall with your legs apart. I lowered myself to sit between your legs. My back pressed into your chest leaning into you as you had your arms around me, you caressed me. You hugged me gentle with one arm and pet my hair with the other, all the while smiling that smug, cheeky smirk like you had everything under control.. as you usually do. We didn't exchange many words throughout but we didn't need to. Like a daddy holding his little girl, I felt safe there in that dream world I created so far from reality.Its silly the truths and secrets we both knew the whole time but never talked about. It was a game of fantasy and you won. you all did. I was 23 when I met you, officially through this site but enjoyed the build up through another.. I often wonder how random or set up our connection really was. I spent a few hours of my 24th bday on your couch. same old, same old but still became my favorite place to be. I would have done anything I could for you once upon a time. I tried a couple times to offer what you really wanted.. by now it has probably been fulfilled by another. I put my real person and feelings out there enough times and again recently reached out through fb but for what reason? I don't even really know considering I'm 27 now to be engaged..and you're probably off doing what you love, to who you love, perfectly content to be rid of me or no difference in your life whatsoever rather. I hope you're well anyhow. why can't I just let you go? It took a long time to really forget you and still, I don't think I ever will. I wish I could see you. I don't know why or really what for but I wish you wanted to see me too.Maybe I'm just seeking better closure with you. I know you meant much more to me then I ever did to you so is this just a waste of time and an extra ego boost for you? I don't know. Probably but oh well. I don't mind stroking your ego a bit, never did mind pleasing you any way possible.. I do what I feel is right at the time and so I reached out to contact you.I'm in van for less then a week now before im gone again. this is my last attempt to reach you since I deleted your number back when I had to force myself to get over you. For months I couldn't check any of the old sites including this one. I avoided any memory of you I could but around last christmas you shocked me with a text yet, never replied back to mine so I deleted your number. Then, of course out of nowhere you just had to appear on my fb like a punch to the heart making my nerves jump. I couldn't ignore it. I know I should take the hint but at this point its not like I have anything to lose by sending this message into the universe hoping to reconnect. Perchance you will see this. whether you reply or not, I hope you do see it. my number hasn't changed so if you still have it and are at all interested please know id accept your text or call if you dared. I know you have my FB. In spite of everything, I'm obviously reaching out Again.. Please consider giving me a real truce. no games or teases. no bs. something genuine. You meant a lot to me. P.S.Remember the very specific reason we met in the first place? At that dog park with the name that still haunts me to this day.. well the reason still needs taking care of and is ready. Just sayin.. no one ever finished the job, the one that was rightfully yours.. The best gift I ever got. Thank you. And btw judging from the pictures you look amazing. good job. just hope you didn't get limp dick in the process.. bye Jacobsorry for the excruciating long message. T."

You got off the train before me and I didn't see you so I figured I'd lost you as I walked down the escalator and crossed the street to head to the bus stop. Then I got on the 401 Garden City at about 10:10, went to sit at the back, and noticed your purple hair again and saw your face. Your face was as I imagined, as it matched your hair--beautiful. You had your hood on so that's why I didn't see you before but I could still see your purple hair with hints of blonde coming through. Your nose ring and makeup looked great on you as well. You were wearing a black and blue checkered jacket, and medium high boots. You were sticking them out a bit and I thought of tripping over them on purpose to start a conversation but I was too scared. I think I actually touched your boot a bit though so I apologize for that. I'm hoping that by some miracle you see this and reply. It would be so amazing to hear from you or see you again.

On Monday Oct 26th I went to an audition for a Thankgiving commercial where we had partners and you were mine. I'm not the type of person to try and strike up a conversation during auditions due to the fact that I like to keep things professional and didn't want to make things uncomfortable because we needed to show ""chemistry"" on camera lol.

winter,Vancouver,w4m,Friends - w4m,"I get what your saying. I do. Haven't posted in like months. I am not the person who responded to your original post. No. I thought about it and while I was angry regret certain things, I wanted you to know that all I ever wanted was to get to know you and go for coffee. You know, like normal people do. I realize you're just being yourself, and for whatever reason, you can't just call me and ask me how I am and let's go for coffee. But you're you and I'm sure your tactics are just as valid.  I guess that's my lesson to learn. I'm not perfect. There's been a lot of drama and misunderstanding. And it's too bad. Some things can't be fixed. But this is how I view it- what I did yesterday was try to be real with you. No masks, just myself. And I put it out there and I know one way or another, it comes back. I put myself in front of you and I just see what happens. Because that's real. That's honest. It's not a fantasy world. That's how I get the answer I need which is that it's just not right or not the right time etcOn here is a waste of time. And it just infuriates me. I don't want any part of it. when I see a message for me, i ignore it because it's a turnoff. I care about you. Always have. And another thing that you don't know either- I watch you from afar too, and you should be very proud of all that you've accomplished. I respect you highly. And if we had ever spent any time together, you would feel that from me. I don't want to say a bitter goodbye. If it's goodbye, then I hope for something more peaceful. And I don't have an agenda. And I don't lie. When I say the online situation is not good, I mean my wordsThe negative intimacy was set a long time ago. And if I'm honest, it breaks my heart because there was never any good reason for it. I didn't know it was you back then getting in touch with me. And if you had made that clear, there wouldn't have been a problem. What's the use."

winter,Vancouver,mw4mw,Know me? Edit - mw4mw,"Anyone know me? (Burnaby)My initials are ZR and my name rhymes with loose. i like to tell girls what they want to hear and have them commit to only me and make them get tested so i can freely have my way with many girls at once so i don't have to wrap my Hercules (dk) . I will tell you that i dont do hook ups and you are special and tell you all that i only want you and plan on staying in town because of you. I play the success card unsuccessfully and i spend too much money on random dates so i won't buy you anything except maybe a cheap dinner and movie so I can get into your pants consistently. I will make many empty promises to shut you up until I find time to fk the batch out of you. I will tell you to check up on me and call anytime but don't ever ask to see my phone or where I was because I'll make up a lie like playing video games by myself or call you insane. I will talk on the phone with you in the shower and while I'm working out at work and text the girl i want that night at the same time. I won't show you concrete proof that I'm not a player but i will send you pics to keep you trusting me so i never have to tell you the truth. I am a hypocrite and a pathological liar and when i ask you must make sure you show me your phone but never ask the same of me. I will make you feel extra special and that I'm special when I'm actually just scum. I have never actually been tested because you girls fall for my stories and get tested for me and you have such little experience with men you can't see my contradictions and fall easily. You don't realize how deeply disturbed and insecure I am unless you start asking deep questions about my exes which I will lie about to you so you don't go searching anyway. if i haven't already told you how obsessive they are to me then it's coming because I'm lying to myself and don't think for once that i will tell you that a few have threatened with restraining orders against me because i won't leave them alone and keep trying to bang them. I'm so confused that if you ask me one question about my integrity I'll turn it around on you and make you question yourself to divert from myself. Because i don't have integrity i only wish i did. I laugh because you all believe me and never really test me and i get away with it everytime :-)From M, L, T and anonymous"

I know that the chances of you reading this are slim to none, but your trying to get a hold of me has brought back a flood of memories that I have tried to release for all these years. I am glad that back in that July evening of 2012 I told you I no longer wanted to see you as you were on an extended vacation back you your hometown in England. I can't believe that I had fallen for you and was blind to the fact that you wouldn't leave your wife for me even though you said you would. When we met you had only really 2 things that I loved you are British and the accent is hot and I always told you that and you are Indian and I love brown men. Other than that the qualities you have are not very attractive.I know you told me you love me and you would leave your wife and we could be together with your children. I done a lot for you over that year. I changed a lot in my life to accommodate you and make you happy. I would cook you a hot lunch when you would come for our weekly get together, I would give you incredible oral whenever you wanted me to and was open sexually to your slightly twisted sex you liked to have. I even changed my bedding to satin as you loved it, but I hated it! I am glad I got my head on straight and stopped our late night dirty texting while your wife was asleep. I have let you go a long time ago and realized I should never have fallen in love with you as you used me. Take care and stop calling and texting please"

We met each other at the McDonald Restaurant in Downtown of Vancouver at about 1:30 AM on October 25, 2015. It was a rainy day and you were with 2 of your friends there. One of them is a girl and the other one is a guy. You did not realize that I was sitting besides you until you turned around to me. Then I said:""Hi"" to you. You responded:""Hi"" Sorry for not letting you know that I was sitting besides you, Taylor, I wish that I did not make you feel shocked. In our brief conversation, I told you that my name is Michael and you told me that your name is ""Taylor"". Then I said:"" Oh, it sounds like a guy's name."" You said:""It is a boy's name, my parents named me ""Taylor"", I did not know why."" Then we laughed... When you were about to leave the McDonald Restaurant in Downtown, Vancouver, I asked for your phone number from you because I really enjoyed talking with you and I really did not want to lose contact with you from then on. When you heard I said""What is your phone number? Taylor"" You stopped there and turned around to me with a sincere and sweat smile on your face:""...I was also married, but it was very nice to meet you."" Quite a few days have passed, but I still can not forget about how we met and chatted with each other, Taylor. It was just like yesterday and your words, your style and your smile have left a deep impression on my mind, Taylor. It was very regretful that we did not have more time to get to know each other better on that night in order for us just to be friends. I graduated from McMaster University and I am going to start working as a Naval officer soon. Please call me or email me at michaelvtao at yahoo dot ca"

You asked if I was OK and I sort of looked around confused because I thought maybe you were talking to someone else.I wanted to say thanks: I didn't really hear what you said which is why I was confused. I'm deaf in one ear, and that's the side you were on so it didn't really register. I was kind of just taking a paused but the stress of the workday and a bunch of things having gone wrong lately was looming on me heavily so I just had a lot on my mind. It was really nice of you to ask, and I'm sorry I didn't engage you more. I was sort of shocked by the concern of a stranger I guess, which says a lot about Vancouver and the world in general."

So as of today with unarguable unarguable proof. The fact is I was not imagining any of it. There was nothing wrong with me at all, I was just harshly played by you. You didn't even keep your promise for a month. It has been a long time and finally that always turning grinding ball in my gut has stopped. No longer is there a fight in myself between your actions and your words. No longer do I question the words of those who tried to warn me and no longer does that image of that girl I met early in the morning at that campout take any room in my head. It was never real, you don't exist. I was fine being just who I was and you did your best to destroy him, you knew perfectly well what you were doing to him. Your parents were never there for you because you don't exist.No more words from you, everything is a lie.It would be so easy to just do something that would hurt you in some way. Some people have been doing doing that as it is appearant I am not the first.Please no replys to this post. Deleting my email account. Won't need it any longer."

I wish I could tell you how I feel about you, about how I lay awake in bed some nights thinking about your gorgeous eyes or the peach fuzz above your lips. But you're happily married... Or at least that's how it comes across. I'm married too. We both have the same number of kids. We see each other weekly. And I look forward to the days I get to run into you. I just wish one day you would engage me more than just the casual pleasantries we share. I love my wife and kids. I don't want to change that - ever. But I am convinced that a man can love two women, in two completely different ways, and still be true to himself. I wish one day you would get to know how I feel about you. Till then I will continue to dream of you and your sweet face."

winter,Vancouver,m4w,Attention - m4w,"It is hard not to scratch my head when I see you use words like attention towards another. Call another person a liar yet it is all you have done to everyone. List my lies? I will list yours. You can't even base anything on fact you have to resort to creating lies which you include your own daughter in. You can't even come clean about the double lie you created and played your performance that started everything. Constant little conniving performances for what purpose? No walking up to someone while they are having a conversation and slapping their face putting on a performance who is the attention seeker? Who was always looking for a handout with the poor little me act? I was a good enough smudge for you to try and use. It is you who is a smudge and I have more than enough compassion love faith and many traits that are based on helping others. They just are not there for you anymore because those things mean nothing to you unless you are the one taking them. You have no capability to give them. I would love you to tell me what I lied about but can you be honest and admit everything from the begining? No therefore you won't stop this CL thing. I am waiting for the one day none of your craps is here. You have lost your beauty inside and out that is why you resorted to the street corner. It is the attention you seek that destroys your life and the deception about it that ruins others lives. You can't even answer why you do it. As for why tell you about finding love? So you know you did not ruin me and win. That you are not the one in everyone's dreams like you need to be. You are filled with such hate and need. Anyone who knows you long enough to get past your victim routine gets the slap in the face of the real you. So go ahead keep selling your ass as love, eventually all figure out they were just paying for ass"

I feel really sorry for people like you that live in misery and someday when he's in danger you'll be happy someone was there. I'm a happy individual and I feel for you and your personality.

There's something about you that causes my eyes to keep peering in your direction. I know you see me glancing at you but it doesn't seem to bother you. In fact, I've noticed you looking at me quite often too! I'm not shy and though I've wanted to talk to you on many occasions, I haven't because my guess is you're married and I didn't want to offend you. Not sure I could keep myself from flirting once we started talking even if you told me you're married! ha ha When we said ""hi"" to each other yesterday, I so badly wanted to tell you how beautiful your smile was. :) Not good at guessing a women's age so I'd say you're somewhere in your 30's? If you think this might be you and want to chat, let me know where the laundromat is and what nationality you think I am (I'm not EI)."

winter,Vancouver,m4w,Re: I Miss you - m4w,"Care to elaborate a bit more by posting your and/or his initials?Original message...I miss you. I know it's been awhile since our breakup, and we don't talk anymore, but I still think of you. I miss your eyes, and your smell, and the feeling of your hands in mine. The last time I saw you, you looked happy. You were with a friend, and you were laughing. I don't think you saw me. You looked like you'd moved on. I didn't get the sense that you missed me at all, and that hurt. I was just wondering if you ever still thought of me, and all the good times we shared together. All the nights out, and the little texts, and the sharing of secrets that I've never had the guts to share with anyone else. Maybe there's someone new in your life who does those things for you. I don't know. I'm just rambling on a Sunday evening by myself, I guess. Wherever you are, and whatever you do, please take care, and stay true to yourself. And know that if you ever need a friend, I'm just a phone call or email away."

I was walking in the opposite direction with an Asian female, probably looking grungy as ever--especially in comparison to you, with your nice red sweater on. But you still held my stare, and boy did I get lost in those dark eyes of yours. I'm Middle Eastern as well, and on the day, I had on a cap, grey jacket and black sweats. Like I said: grungy. If you see this and are interested, I'd love to hear from you."

I checked you out in the gym at Steamworks last night Saturday, November 14, about 7pm. You were wearing boots, leather assless chaps, leather vest, leather jock and chest harness, with a handsome face with moustache and gotee and well built maybe late 40's. Total leather top fantasy man for me. You were doing some intense personal training with a young trainee. I watched you from the locker area pretending to be at my locker on my phone, but I was watching you. You were putting your trainee through some serious workout drills and were correcting him and encouraging him. I was wishing I was him. I walked past a couple of times to check you out and you were even hotter up close and packing a very big bulge in your leather jock. I know you looked at me but I was in a white towel and looked totally vanilla so I was probably invisible to you. I hit the gym regularly and I would be your gym bitch to your strict personal trainer and service you post workout. I looked for you around the club later but never saw you or your trainee boy. It was my fantasy that you had him in one of the sling rooms to continue his training. Lucky boy. From overhearing you in the gym, you really know what you are doing and are super strict which is what I need. I would be willing to pay you for some gym tips or service you any way you like in trade. I jacked off when I got home thinking of being with you naked in the gym and getting all sweaty doing what I'm told and now at noon Sunday have to try this option. Don't want you to think I'm a creepy stalker, and I don't know if you were at that gym as a one of or if that trainee was your partner, boyfriend or client. If you tell me what your trainee was wearing during the training session so I know it's you; I'd be totally up for wearing the same thing or naked for a personal training session with you. Ross"

The night we met and we went for a ride on my motorcycle was actually the highlight of my year so far. Have such a beautiful woman on the back of my bike I felt like a million dollars. Not that is all I see in you, you are so much more than that. You are smart, well mannered, well dressed, you take care of yourself wonderfully. Nevermind the fact that you are a biker chick too! I got to say though the way you had wrapped your arms around me a few times just wow I think you reached around deep into my soul and stole it cause I have not been able to stop thinking of you ever since. I know I came across as a douche bag at the end of our ride though...and that's what's killing me cause I would never think ill of you and I don't think you had any intensions of what I said. I know I said sorry many times and I sent texts and emails apologizing...and I never got a reply. Not until 2 or 3 months later and you text me up saying that you are...well you know what you said. You don't know how excited I was to actually hear from you wow and just as fast as you bounced back in with in a day you seemed to bounce back out. Look I know your situation is complicated and all but you deserve better than that and don't ever think that he is worth it cause once they do it they will always do it. I would never do that to you...why that was even a thought or an action is beyond me! What an idiot he is to mess around with perfection. He has to be legally retarded or something.

We sat for a moment and talked about my day while I waited for my food. You were polite as you listened and puffed on your vape.

winter,Vancouver,m4w,"it's been over 10 years, R - m4w","what a life.It's been over 10 years since we've seen each other or spoken, and we've both moved on with our respective existences. Filled up all the empty with new friends, new jobs, new houses... It's like the years from our 20s and early 30s was a completely different life that somebody else lived, and the memories of it now -- in waking life -- are akin to the memories of a book we once read.When I try to picture your face, all I get are snapshots which are more like a memory of a photo. I can't remember what it sounds like to hear you laugh. I can't remember your smell (although I'm sure my olfactory would, should that scent ever cross in front of me one day. ""Oh! I remember now!"") and to be honest, I don't think about any of that too often -- in waking life.But the dreams like last night's dreams (which are extremely rare now) are the opposite of all that, and I can't help but wonder if there's still some old astral thread that ties us together in some other place that's safer and easier and more beautifully simple than what is here... on the outside.I can't help but wonder if sometimes when those vivid, lucid and so painfully loving dreams come on with you -- if maybe you're going through a tough time.Well, if you are, and you will know who you are, when I said I would always Love you unconditionally, I still do. So there's that, at least.That doesn't mean anything changes, but maybe it's just nice to know. Wishing the best for you, and thanks for the visit. It was so nice to see you again."

winter,Vancouver,w4w,re: It's time for Craigslist to shut down Missed Connections - w4w,"You say that nobody wants to read those achey futile letters some of us post on this board, but you're wrong. I appreciate that you don't like reading them and it bothers you that people aren't respecting the Craigslist rules, but the solution is obvious enough that I won't patronize you with it. You don't need to control everything, and the sooner you realize that, the less fuel you'll find yourself adding to the very fires you're trying to put out.And to those brave and heavy hearts who are generous enough to bare their souls on here--despite all these petty suckerpunchers trying to make MC into a boring web version of I Saw You--fuck those other guys. Thank you for the intimacy and vulnerability and earnestness you share here. Please don't stop or feel bad about what you give this board. I know personally I wouldn't be checking here after all these years if the only joy I could expect from MC was the possibility someone might have thought I looked hot on the bus. That's child's play. Being sincere and showing your weaknesses, however, that's the shit that makes people worth meeting."

winter,Vancouver,w4m,Green Quarter-Zip Sweater: Met you in a VGH elevator on October 7th - w4m,"I trudged up to await an elevator on the evening of October 7th at the end of my shift on a ward at VGH. I'm a tall blonde in my mid-twenties. I have no clue what I was wearing, but I know I was clutching some folded-over paperwork and my little daily journal. I didn't notice you at first. Suddenly I realized you were standing next to me when you made some casual, hyperbolic comment about exactly how slow those elevators are. We made eye contact and I quickly looked away. You had a lovely deep voice and the most charming, eager smile on your face.You carried on the conversation in a way that felt and seemed effortless. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see you watching me while you spoke with your head tilted to one side, like you were trying to figure me out. You told me you were visiting a friend who was admitted to the other side of the floor we were on. You had thick golden dirty blonde or light brown hair parted to one side, an easy laugh, and wore a crisp dark green quarter-zip pullover sweater and maybe jeans. You looked about my age or maybe a few years older.The elevator finally arrived. Before we could say anything else to each other, hoards of people piled in on the next floor. They all trickled off until it was just the two of us in the elevator again. The air was electric with all the potential words we had for each other. With our brief connection. You struck the conversation up once again. I maintained probably metres of distance between us.We left the elevator and you asked me, ""How the hell do we get out of this place?"" I told you I didn't know - I don't usually work at VGH - but I would show you my way. Outside the hospital, the rain was beginning to pick up from a soft drizzle to a moderate downfall, and we both marched out into it without one umbrella between us. You laughed and pointed your face to the sky to let the rain soak you. You had such a disarmingly genuine spirit. I finally lost my guard and laughed with you. We were both drenched.We talked about your promising career in insurance, and my budding career. You told me your name but it promptly slipped from my memory. We walked for a few blocks as it began to rain harder and harder. When we stopped to go separate ways, you took my hand in yours and shook it. You held my hand in yours a few moments longer than necessary while you asked me whether you could have my card or my phone number.I stammered and declined.I've been kicking myself ever since, insurance guy in the green sweater. If this finds you, let's get a drink!"
winter,Vancouver,m4w,Carole - from North Van - m4w,"I enjoyed keeping you company while you waited for family to arrive after crossing the border. Your sister-in-law did what she could to embarrass you, but you kept that warm smile... beautiful photobomb!At the end of the concert my copilot urgently needed to do what nature commands after drinking wine, and we couldn't risk getting separated (her husband would not have been impressed if I lost her). I startled you as I put my contact info in your hand in a clumsy handshake, then my neighbour and I rapidly left, coming to a screeching halt the back of a line. D'oh!On the drive home I didn't have answer to her question why didn't I ask for your number. It just seemed safer for you to control contact, if you sensed a connection. If it seemed presumptuous, lazy, too laissez faire or if you're just not interested, my apologies.You made quite an impression on someone who doesn't impress easily. Please accept this as a sincere, if awkward compliment. I would love to see that bright smile again, Carole."

winter,Toronto,w4m,Running in to you with my dog all the time - w4m,"I used to run into you a lot while I was walking my dog. Usually you would be coming home from work or going to get food at Metro.We said hi to each other for months before we actually had a conversation and properly introduced ourselves. I never asked for your number because I always assumed I would see you frequently, and I had seen you a few times a week for probably the last year. After awhile of not crossing paths once you saw me you had said ""I thought you moved away I haven't seen you in so long"". Now it's been months and I'm kicking myself for not asking to hang out. We flirted a fair bit and my dog just loves you which is strange considering how shy he generally is.I live the street just North of yours, and I used to work where you do but we'd never met there. If you want to reconnect and grab a coffee or beer sometime, reply with your name and the company you work for so I know it's you.Hope to catch up!"

winter,Toronto,w4m,Work homies - w4m,"We met two years ago this month on a long car trip. The day felt full of cold, hazy magic. I thought you were adorable and that you'd never be interested in me. But at the end of the trip, you turned to me and said something that made it clear you felt a unique connection. It suddenly all seemed like too much. I panicked and bolted from the car before you could say anything more. I really regret it. You sent me that album we'd listened to all day but I didn't hear anything more from you for months. I played the album often and thought of you. I guessed you'd forgotten about me. In the summer, suddenly, I found out we'd be working together. You came up to my room one night. But after sitting on the edge of my bed for an awkward while you suddenly up and left. We've spent countless hours hanging out until late in the night since then. But you never made a move. And we've kept in relatively frequent touch too. Though, lately it's mostly been my doing. I don't often meet men I can really see myself with. You've got an endless stream of bizarre quirks. So much I want to learn more about. You're not a perfect person. Neither am I. But I really respect you. And I have fun with you. I am interested in you in a million different ways. I should assume that you simply decided you weren't interested. But when I see you, I'm not as sure. When I see you I feel like there is still something there but that you're simply not willing/able/comfortable communicating it to me. Even this dim little whiff of hope is enough to keep my thoughts focused on you. I would make a move on you if I were braver. And if I were sure my advances would be welcomed. But I like working with you and I don't want to jeopardize that. More, I think you like to do things on your own schedule. Rushing you seems like the wrong approach.If you are at all interested in me romantically, in taking action and moving things to another level, please for the love of god say something. Do something. Let me know. I have to move on but I can't until I know for sure that there is no hope. I beg you, please relieve me."

winter,Toronto,t4t,re:Narsassist - t4t,"You can not have control over everybody's emotions.It doesn't work that way.True love is a gift-when given should cherish it.If you really want a relationship to work-pick up a phone and communicate your feelings-hiding your emotions isn't healthy and at least you would know. Life is too short for games. Seriously people-grow up!"
winter,Toronto,m4w,To you from me - m4w,"I am here. Wondering where you are.Life was never good enough if I could not be the person I wanted to be.For me. For you. In fact, it became an image of hoplessness amidst the best thing in the world. The best thing was you.I'm not ready, I thought to myself. Not to be in a wonderful relationship for life, when I do not have all the answers. Not enough of them, which would inevitably drive the one that loves me - away. But yet, here she is. The one I love is here. Right in front of me.This was 8 years ago, or so.That hasn't changed. I still feel you. Some days I tell myself you've moved on.Some days my existence is shattered when I imagine you have.Some times I wait for the inevitable. That you will. Give it 10 years. If you have not done so, you more than likely will.& if you wait for some reason - I will have failed you for not finding you. I torment myself with a mind that is not quite able to express the beautiful happenings between two wonderful people beyond a set of words on a page. It tires me.We can all dream. We can all forget. I carry you with me, through the most inconspicuous of places. I love you, N. From the moment I saw you. And I am scared. I still love you when I am vunlerable. When the world does not see the same person I used to be.When the world dismisses the very nature of oneself that can grow into something great.I love you, if I become that person I wanted to be. As much as I torture myself with stubbornness - for the sake of growing into something better. I'll fight for the chance to make things real. Make a life that makes sense. That enables the feelings that were and are oh so right. I owe it to myself to try and never stop. I owe it to you. You gave me that chance. Even though I'm failing. Falling. It's such a journey when time is in fact a part of the equation. I don't have a choice. You are worth it to me. More than I can ever say. & I hope that if I ever am lucky enough to cross paths - that every little action - every little mistep towards building something with you is not miscontrued as anything but my endless love for you. I'd love to show it to you, one word, feeling and song at a time. One touch, to make up for those we yearned for. For the times where I sat and stood paralyzed; when you deserve my best.My best - is the only thing good enough. A letter to you through the universe."

winter,Toronto,m4w,"Re: ""I wish I was older so I could be with you"" - m4w","It doesn't really matter that you're younger than me, we're really not supposed to be together. I'm there for you to learn from me and my experience. I will inspire you and open up your mind to different ways of thinking and looking at people and the world. It's ok if you love me, but don't let it stop you from living your life. Like I said , we're not supposed to be together.After a few years, you will have grown a lot and be much smarter than you are now. You will be ready to have children, and will want to have children, but you will know to do it the right way. Then you will come to me for my sperm. You won't get caught in the trap and have kids with any idiot asshole off the street, that calls himself your ""boyfriend"". You will know better by then. It's not really ME that you love, it's my semen. So you will gradually learn what's true and what's real over the next few years, but right now, you're still naive and in the dark. You will come back to me when you're a bit older."

winter,Toronto,w4m,Strong Psychic Connection - w4m,"From the darkest basement of my tree house cabin,where light only filters through in the late afternoon.Amidst the potions and lighters, spells and vialsI am still hoping to find the trail of bread crumbs To your cookie house. That imaginary roomWhere we conceived our daughter, Bridge.Wrapped up in cotton sheets at midnight. With the halo of the moon casting a silver sheen on our skins.The warmth of me beside you. My thoughts etched on your slate.My visions a mystery swirling around the Northern Sea.You keep looking for the words you traced on my navelTo surface on my skin. Silent and heavy. But the letters turn into goose bumps. Your highness. I'm waiting for them to call you out. More battles to be fought. More gold to be usurped.I'm left with rainbows behind glass. Your movements in the morning hours rouse me from my dreams. Of dead pets and electromagnetic candy. Bridge's feet pad in the doorway. A silent child. You return her to me, before you're leaving. A perfunctory sorrow is in your eyes. You hide them. I smile. Bridge takes my index in her palm. Your highness is prone to politeness. How will you kiss me? Like you will miss me.Until we meet again whenever chance allows. Or like you will send men to do away with me. An embarrassment, a blemish in court. I wonder if being rendered helpless should hurt me. Having only my essence by which to keep you. I did not invite you. You came anyways. But I care for a sweeter parting. I braid a wreath of sweet grass and light it. Over a brass plate, an exotic smell for you. One who smokes tobacco. Our hands meet.My newest fantasy in your hand again. No please. I have to leave. Then go. I can't hear your feet. ~Your Lady in waiting."

I truly never want to regret knowing u as I loved u with all my heart.

winter,Toronto,w4m,Gentleman walked me home to Spadina - w4m,"We met at Yonge and St Clair while I was on the phone and you asked if there were busses or if I wanted to share a cab east, I told you I wanted to walk. We talked about how you're going to have to rearrange your Thursday schedule because you went out on a Wednesday with the boys on the Danforth.

winter,Toronto,w4m,I wonder if you read those emails - w4m,"I wonder if you really read any of those emails I sent or if you just deleted them as soon as you saw my name. I know you blocked me after that one message, the one that was probably hardest to read, but it was the truth and I felt you needed to know. I needed to tell you. And then you cut me off from any form of contact after that. So I guess now all I have is this. When I told you I loved you, I said I knew because I had been in love before. But that wasn't true. You were the first person I really loved and the only person I've loved since. Imagine how frustrating that is, considering you want nothing to do with me.I try to forget everything that happened between us, and even though it comes up in my memory so often, the truth is I am quite happy and I feel optimistic about my future. I like myself and I enjoy spending time alone since there are only a handful of people that I really feel comfortable with anyway. But it hurts to know how much I care about you, how amazing it was to just sit and talk and listen to records and laugh with you, and to know now how little you care about me. What an annoying situation.-H"

I was looking forward to waiting for my coffee with you and hopefully, get to connect with you. Unfortunately, I realised that I had forgotten my wallet and had to go back home to get it.

You did a lot for me to show me you cared and I wasnt ready for such a big step and took you for granted...words can't even begin to express how truly sorry I am.

winter,Toronto,m4w,To S - m4w,"Dear SWe haven't spoken in months, and it's been a pretty hard time for me. I'm sober now.. I know you aren't but I am. I wonder how you would feel about that. Proud?Indifferent? Disdainful? It was very hard to come to terms with but I finally admitted to myself that I have an addiction and sought help.I can't explain to you how useless, fucked up and afraid I felt that first night in detox. It would have been impossible to sleep without the pills they gave me. The hallucinations alone were bad enough but the shakes were the worst. That first morning, I was shaking so bad that I spilled my coffee all over my tray. It had been just over 24 hours since the last time I drank.It's been so hard to do this alone. I know that's a weird thing to say since we used to drink together at the level you'd expect of alcoholics but being with you made me feel like a normal person whether we were drinking or not. I actually thought about you more than I thought about getting drunk. I know that it's not exactly Shakespeare, but that's about as close to love as I think I'm capable of. I miss you. I wish you were sober so that I could even consider reaching out to you, but you aren't. I've come too far to risk it.It's getting easier for me with time. I've been sober for five months. I haven't been sober for longer than 1 month in a decade. The shaking is long gone and I sleep soundly. I still have dreams of drinking, and you're always in them. It tears me apart. But I can do this, I've managed this far. It's you that I worry about..Be safe"

winter,Toronto,m4w,Lorraine S - m4w,Days like today when I'm sad and I think you don't think about me or have moved on from us are the days I Miss You. I miss your beautiful face. I miss laughing and talking about everything. I miss our tickle fights. We have started to text again but I know it's only as friends but I can tell you are still struggling with it. It hurts when you just stop texting back and I don't know why. I want you to know that I am committed to changing and getting out of my depression. I know your the only one for me you are my soul mate and I believe you feel the same or else you wouldn't be struggling so much since you said there was still open wounds. If it takes my whole life trying to prove to you it wasn't me who hurt you and made you feel unloved it was someone who was afraid to admit they had something wrong with them and wasn't man enough to fix it until possibly too late. Please give me a chance to show you are am willing to change and to make up for all the mess I made. It's getting harder and harder to hold onto hope that there is a slim chance that you can see I'm making changes.

winter,Toronto,m4w,"You went searching for everything, yet it was right in front of you... - m4w","When I told you I really only have you in my life, I truly meant it. I deal with so much stress and depression outside of us that it's taken its toll on my body. No one my age should have to deal with that stuff. But, you, you are my happiness. You are the thing I looked forward to in life. Every time I think of my future, eleven times out of ten you're in it. Through everything that I've dealt with, you help make my pain numb. All I need is that beautiful smile of yours to reassure me that 'it'll be alright kid'. And you know I don't have friends that I can talk to, and to be honest, I don't care to make friends because all I need is you. You're my best friend and my companion in this thing called life. I lean on you for every pain and sorrow that I experience, just as you come to me during your darkest, most troubling times. I was always there for you - I never left your sight. Just as I kept a look out for you from the corner of my eye from day 1, I still maintained that look years down the road. However, to realize that your recent actions are also adding to that pain, pain that I thought would never come from my beloved one, it truly breaks my heart. I've been hurt before, but this time, this one hurts the most. My heart was hanging on a thread, and you cut it and made sure it would never be put back together. I never thought someone so close and dear to me would hurt me in the worst way possible - not once, but several times, over and over. I forgave you and loved you endlessly and I did not give up on you no matter what. I believed in you and in your potential. I fucking love you so much. I gave you my all in every sense possible. I gave my heart and soul to you and you only. I saved myself for you. You were my first love and my only love. In a world where people hook up, have multiple partners, fool around etc., I was a constant and steady figure. I did not need to be with anyone else, nor did I need to gaze at anyone ...for the love that I had for you was enough to fill any void. I loved/love you so much that I have run out of love to give to anyone else. I don't even give my own family the same treatment. Couldn't you see that I was made for you, you stupid girl? Every fibre and every molecule and atom within me was designed for you. It exists for you. It was made for you. It was catered to you. Physically we're perfect together. I am not a shallow person, but we always talked about how beautiful and unique our children would be because of our combination and genes. I fully agree that they would've been something special. Above all that, you know the type of father I'd be to your kids. And when we make love, it's like solving the perfect puzzle, our bodies are always listening to one another, in harmony. Yet, none of that mattered to you in the end, I just wasn't enough. Despite everything, I will still love you forever like no one else in this universe. I always want more of you and I want you now. I already miss you and hearing your voice, but it won't be fair to me. The love, adoration, affection, lust, desire, and need that I have for you will not exist for anyone else. I gave it all to you thinking we'd be together forever. I thought all those talks we had about growing old, raising beautiful babies together, going on adventures, seeing the world, opening restaurants, living our dreams together, I thought they were all genuine and real. I believed everything you told me. I fell for it repeatedly.Moreover, you have forgotten all of the great things I have achieved in the past several months, and not once have you congratulated me for those milestones. Not only that, but you were so caught up with temporary people that you didn't realize I wasn't well. Everything I am doing is for you. All the money that I am saving up is for you. I do everything in my power to make sure I don't spend a single penny on myself because I want you to have a place for your self. I had planned this extravagant and beautiful evening for Christmas and I spent generously because I dreamed of this moment for years. And above all, I knew how happy it would make you. I knew you would feel like you were on top of the world. I wanted you to feel like pure magic. But, you didn't have the decency to tell me that you were going to hurt me again, you just wanted to use me. I can't believe how naive and gullible I am. I believed every thing you ever told me. You just threw empty words at me to hide your lies. How are you okay with hurting me so damn much? What did I ever do to deserve this? You know my life is already stressful as it is, yet you keep piling more on top of it. Do you enjoy seeing me like this? Unfortunately, for the both of us, we will never know what it would feel like to see your eyes glow this Christmas. I realize now you never appreciated me for me. For being the chill, soft-spoken guy who loved unconditionally through thick and thin. The guy who would break his back for his loved ones. The guy who simply focused on his goals and the girl of his dreams. The guy who could cook anything in the world for her. The guy who maintained a positive outlook on life, no matter the circumstances, in order to keep her happy. The guy who would go across a whole city just to massage her body and check up on her, even if it was for 10 minutes. The guy who could only fall asleep by scrolling through the pictures of the girl he loved. The guy who never batted an eye at another girl, nonetheless talked to other females. The guy who remembered every milestone in their relationship. The guy who would stay up just to catch her if she was in a different time zone. The guy who remembered every word she said and every word she didn't say. The guy who cherished the most minuscule memories as if they were the last ones. The guy who would tear up every time he expressed his love for her and every time he felt her touch. The guy who would keep all of her fallen hairs and save them in a box of memories in his bedroom. The guy who would make sure to say 'I love you and goodnight' because he always feared it would be the last time he would say it. The guy who stayed loyal even when the world said he shouldn't. The guy who stayed true to the relationship and respected it. The guy who would surprise her at work with home cooked meals and her favorite snacks. The guy who falls in love every time he sees her big beautiful eyes. The guy who has never missed a prayer in her name for the past 1520 days. The guy who always holds her when she's walking down a set of stairs. The guy who calls her up whenever his intuition tells him something is up. The guy who's idea of fun is cuddling together, watching movies, and talking about life. The guy who maintained his appearance in order to make sure she felt proud to be with him. The guy who would brush aside all the hateful, rude, nasty comments in order to maintain the peace between them. The guy who did not stop doing any of that for over 4 years. The guy who loved so much that it left him to pieces in the end...I hope the decisions you have made are wise ones, I hope you are happy with everything that you have done, I hope you remember how forgiving and caring and loyal I was to you, I hope you will remember everything that I did for you over the years, I hope you remember how beautiful and pure everything was before you destroyed it, I hope those memories burn into your heart and soul, and I hope you see my face whenever you look in the mirror because you will never see me again in person. You will never know what it's like to love infinitely, I did once upon a time...""I'd ask you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone that could level you with her eyes, feeling like God put an angel on earth just for you. Who could rescue you from the depths of hell. And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel, to have that love for her, be there forever, through anything, through cancer. And you wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in the hospital room for two months, holding her hand, because the doctors could see in your eyes, that the terms ""visiting hours"" don't apply to you. You don't know about real loss, 'cause it only occurs when you've loved something more than you love yourself. And I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much"". ~ Robin Williams"

winter,Toronto,w4m,time doesnt make it better - w4m,You know i keep telling myself that not having you contact me is good for me but that night in august still haunts my mind when im alone by myself. I cry its funny. I still want to know why you went so far why you think you didnt do anything. Why am i suffering with the whys? You need help for 2 years i took care of you the best i could. All i wanted from you was you to do the same love is fucked up you verbally abused me for so long that the things you said i believed were true i was stupid and a whore and worthless. Somedays i still miss when you were good when you showed the side i fell in love with. Now im seeing someone and it scares me cause i see so much of the bad of you in him. But hes sweet and charming 80% of the time. That 20% though it makes me hestitant to wanna keep going on with him. I hate everything you ever did to me cause i know everyone has a bad side but when that bad side makes someone else look bad even though it shouldnt cause they arent you and they will never be you it makes you think how bad you really were. Parts of me will always love you im sorry but its the truth somewhere one day you'll realize you had it real good with me i was down for you 100% even when people told me to walk away for my benefit i stuck around with excuses. Like hes just having a hard time right now he'll be the man i knew again soon. You never did become that man again i miss that man. My heart goes out to the next one who takes you on maybe you'll be better with them.

I found it suspicious when you stopped walking when you heard me and then watched me as I put my trash to the curb. When I went back to get another bin of garbage I noticed that you were a few feet closer upon my return to the curb. I decided to yell at you ""get outta here!!"" As I stomped my foot. You looked over both your shoulders as if to say ""who me!?"" And you didn't budge. I then attempted to run at you while screaming ""AHHHHHHHHH"" to catch you by surprise and scare you. It worked! You ran up a nearby tree and out of site. I think I may have startled my neighbour too because they stood there looking at me in the darkness of the night and said in a monotone voice ""..hey man....everything alright?.."" I replied with ""it is now!"" And walked back inside. In the morning when I went outside I noticed that there was quite a mess waiting for me. It seems that you came back down out of the tree when I went back inside. Not only did you knock over the garbage cans and remove their lids, you shredded almost every inch of the bag and did what appeared to be some sort of Tazmanian devil style spin through all the trash. You also removed all but 3 of the 26 items in my recycling box and left them on my driveway and lawn. If your malicious attack was because I tried to chase you away, then I apologize. If I don't see you before the holidays then I wish you a safe and merry Christmas. Hopefully we can't start fresh in the new year."

Do I randomly ask you a question and then apologize for smoking (gross, I know - sorry)?Anyway, you probably live up the street with your super hot girlfriend and an adorable dog named Walter. I'm not a crazy stalker or anything so no fear, I kind of just wanted to put this out there into the world and carry on with my life (day) and will probably just go meet that random potentially gross guy I am talking to off Tinder tonight.

I will be there at 9:00 pm - google the bar, it is on Danforth ..... not far from Woodbine Subway. You are between 37 and 42 years.Hi There,Write back only if seriously interested.This is my posting.I am a single guy, 40 years. I am hopeful I will meet that elusive female - and obviously there should be attraction / chemistry. I have varied interests inclusive of long walks, hiking, photography, music, playing trumpet, guitar and saxophone - not in that order and not a pro! Also enjoy reading, fitness and horseback riding.I believe having a sense of humor is important - being able to laugh at yourself and laugh at each other.For me open communication, trust, listening and understanding are vital in any relationship.I disagree when others say they can judge attraction and chemistry though pictures - this is 100% untrue because chemistry and attraction are what you feel in your gut when you are face to face and see the others eyes, smile and feel their warmth!I can be very passionate with the right female and with me it is a two way street. I am looking for that spark, that smile, that passion. A female that is athletic and fit. Between 37 and 45 years.Physically I am 5'11"" with shoulder length dark hair, brown eyes, athletic, fit and 185 lbs."

winter,Toronto,m4w,Judgement was passed and I apologize - m4w,"I silently stood in my friends apartment building while patiently waiting for the elevator to come. Moments later the door to the elevator opened and there you stood in all your beauty. I slightly smiled and said ""hello"" then proceeded to press the button to the floor I needed. In the split second that I walked into the elevator a horrendous stench invaded the personal space of my senses, those being scent and taste (Oh yes, I could taste it too). It was a cross between egg, beans, 4 day old moose poop, and a hint of an earthy tone (possibly beets). I gagged because of the invasion but tried to cover it with a fake cough. Your beauty was now tainted by the image of this retched stench (that was clearly a spawn of satan) leaking out of your body. What was I to do!? It was too late to press a different number to get off earlier. I held my breath and decided to wait. Luckily your floor came soon and you got off. I let out a sigh of relieve and was thankful that no more pure evil would be set forth by your body. The elevator proceeded to move towards my floor, but stopped again. The doors opened and yet another very attractive woman was about to grace my presence. As she pressed her button I hear the gag cough! THE GAG COUGH! Omg! She thought it was me!!! I quickly made a face as if to say ""Do you smell that too!?"" But she was not convinced, she thought it was me and was passing judgement. As I walked off of the elevator I apologized in my head to the wonderful woman who I originally blamed this foulness on. It was probably not her at all, but someone else who left her with the unfortunate blame. As I conclude, I must urge the elevator farters to do your best to hold it in for a more appropriate time to help the wrongfully accused. Thank you"

Your mother lived upstairs and was sick, you were taking care of her, I always thought you were a great dude. I believe you got laid off from your job, you were very smart and was not in a rush to get into another company. I was the guy with a sleeve tattoo and a big one on my back. Tall and beefy.

But everything GOOD has to come to an end which was way too soon. I helped get you car out of the ditch, I cracked your heater so you would get in your warm car.

winter,Toronto,m4w,re: A woman's rant - m4w,"Not the original poster of 'A man's rant', which is gone.I'm not usually one to respond to anything on an anonymous site like this but your rant really encompasses what is wrong with society today. I'm sure that the person you were responding to said some things that you viewed as terrible, well you did, because you called them ""toxic"" and said that he needed to have a friend slap him around.My response is to point out the inherent flaw with your logic. How can you tell a person to live their own life and to be respectful and accepting of others decisions if you are not being respectful or accepting of his opinions or his decisions?Your rant actually does everything you are lambasting the OP for and is the crux of all recent social commentary. When somebody puts out a thought that goes against another parties ideology, the last thing they seem to do is consider the perspective of the person who made the argument. Generally, as you pointed out, these ranting ideas come from a personal issue that should be looked at. However, it is much easier to just insult the person and tell them to be respectful, which is not only self righteous (as it makes it clear that you believe your stance to be the end all and be all of conversation, making any sort of growth impossible) but achieves absolutely nothing. I have no problem with the premise of a person being wrong, but you need to actually have reasoning that goes further than 'you need to mind your own business' because that is not an argument, it is a side step from the point someone is trying to make.Live and let live is a fantastic mantra. Perhaps lead by example. If you must call someone out, do so respectfully and attempt to open a dialogue. There are certainly things we all need to work through, not just the OP. On a personal level to you, if you need a set of eyes feel free to send a message my way! Always glad to converse, and perhaps we could discuss the cause for your counter rant, or my response, it's always good to have someone to bounce ideas off of. Have a great day."

winter,Toronto,m4w,Generic Missed Connection #2 - m4w,"I remember you from the subway. The underground transit place, not the sandwich restaurant with annoying pervert Jared as the spokesperson. We were together only briefly, but I wish it was forever. I gazed into your eyes. Your breath smelled like garlic and sour cream, which I found a bit odd for that time of morning. The train was crowded with jostling people, but I think my hand touched yours for a moment. It was electric, and my whole body tingled. I hope it was your hand. Was it your hand? Now I'm not sure. Because that big, hairy biker dude who was squished against us kept winking at me and smiling. He was missing teeth and there was broccoli stuck in the few that remained. Oh God, I hope it was you I was touching.But you might want to think twice. I'm probably a bit too wild for you. From the wrong side of the tracks. I cut those ""do not remove"" labels off my stuffed animals before I sleep with them. I still have a library book I borrowed in 2006, and I'm not even reading it. Sometimes I pay my phone bill a couple of days late. I'm sticking it to The Man. On occasion I mix up my container and paper recycling--yes, on purpose. Yesterday I did a rolling stop at a stop sign, and I was right in front of a police station. You only live once, right?Let's not wait for the next train, or the ship of life may leave the harbor before we've gotten in the driver's seat. Climb aboard my spaceship and we'll set sail for an island in the sun.Write to me NOW. Don't hesitate. I know you're still with HIM, but HE doesn't need to know. I won't tell him because I actually lost his number that time my Blackberry accidentally fell into the... oh, let's not even think about that incident, because the plumber cost me a fortune, and then made silly jokes about having ""wiped"" my phone. But I digress. Just write to me. I promise I'll write back, if I'm not too busy living my life on the edge. Put ""I still love you even after all these years"" in the subject line, and attach your pics so that I know it's really you.I'm an open, albeit overdue, book. My motives are more transparent than a pair of defective yoga pants. Look into my eyes and see my heart, in all its throbbing, pumping glory. Actually, just stick with my eyes. They long to see you again."

She's older now, and has moved on. She hasnt responded to any time ive reached out to her.

winter,Toronto,w4w,Pink boots - w4w,"I've seen you three times now in the neighbourhood: most recently, yesterday. At around 9:20 in the morning, you were walking south on Dundas from Bloor, perhaps having just gotten off the eastbound Bloor bus. On the previous two occasions I've seen you, however, you were riding your bicycle, which, unlike mine, looks new and reasonably well-kept. On both of those occasions I also passed you-- you are a bit slow. :)The pink combat boots you wear caught my eye, as did the skirt with pigeons screen printed on it that you wore one day. I like pigeons quite a lot, so anyone else with a fondness for them is a friend of mine. You were wearing those boots yesterday, too, which was the first thing I saw as I rode through the intersection.I'd wanted to say hello--or anything, for that matter, as I rode past you--but it's just not appropriate to drive-by holler at a woman walking down the street. Not that I am even the ""hollering"" type... but you probably get what I mean. Just in case I don't get the chance to pass you on your bike again: want to grab coffee sometime? And just so I know it's you: what did the coat you were wearing yesterday look like?"

When you thought I wasn't looking you'd look at me and sort of stare but not in a creepy way. Then when I'd look up, you'd look at your phone. I'd look out the window whenever we were above ground and when I'd turn around, you'd be looking at me. We made eyes at each other all the way to Royal York - that's when you gave me one last look as you exited. Hope to hell you'll read this. HMU and tell me what colour shades I was wearing."

Also wearing glasses. Wore a red sweater.I admired your initiative in going to such a challenging film solo. I'm a film enthusiast who finds foreign films, particularly French, far more engaging and provocative. Perhaps we share that passion. Say hi if you're the woman I'm referring to here. I'd like to get your view on the movie. I've always been comfortable seeing films solo but the one disadvantage is there's no one to discuss it with afterward.

winter,Toronto,m4w,For people who post without specific information - m4w,"There have been a lot of posts lately that are completely ambiguous and I must not be the only person being driven nuts by them. Please, if you have something to say to someone whose contact information you already have, speak to them directly! My last relationship was with someone who never communicated directly to me and it ended up breaking my heart. Just talk to each other, people. There's nothing to fear. Whatever the outcome is it's better sitting around torturing yourself with horrible thoughts. A missed connection is one that never got a chance to start. Otherwise it's a broken connection. That's not to say that it can't be fixed, but the only way to do it is to honestly share your feelings with the other person involved. That's the only way to connect with someone. And I wish we all did more of it. Life would be a lot easier."

Either ur heart was never as big as I hoped. Or ur running from the profound love we had. I'm sure that's easier. I never gave up on u when u needed me so very badly to stick by ur side. Unlike ur parents who kept proving they would be there for u in times in which they aprove of. With our love they certainly did not. I've never been good at kissing ass. Nor will I ever. I'm so curious as to whether I made a six year mistake or if ur heart is what I hoped it was. I truly miss grasping u in my once again powerful arms. Im not saying or thinking that anything could come from it. I just want to understand in a selfish way I guess. If u are the sweet girl I fell in love with or i was wrong the whole time. Ur own mom told me one time when u took off on one of ur breakdowns that u are spoiled and u don't seem to appreciate as much as u should. I'll always love ya so much. I'm choosing to focus on the good times. The hugs, the intense love making. Ur head on my powerful chest as we sleep and cuddle. I'll always miss u. I truly wish u the best. I hope that if u are with a man that he can keep u as safe as me. Although I doubt it. :) even as a good friend, I'd give the world to hold u in my arms for a few minutes. I mean that from the bottom of my heart."

Probably a stupid idea but oh well. Met you and your friends outside a pub, as I have a tendency of being too friendly and talking to strangers. I wandered off to make my way home and got a bit lost. Directionally challenged. You walked by and said (please fill in the blank) as you walked by. And we ended up hanging out. I just wanted to say, it was a lot of fun. Have never hung out with a total stranger like that before; such a random night! I did give you my number but if I don't hear from you, just wanted to say thanks :). Hopefully you man up and call me.

You treated me like I was worthless, and I don't know how you get through your days. I can only imagine you think you're doing the right thing. That your actions were necessary for your own well-being. But your actions were in no way necessary and you are not doing the right thing. The right thing never involves using and manipulating the person who treated you better than anyone else has. It's never necessary to destroy the will of someone who did nothing but try to love and comfort you. But you've done all those things. You broke me, so you could feel better. I hope one day you wake up and stop lying to yourself. Because when you do you hurt people. Really badly, and much worse than you know."

It is also interesting the games these people play, they do say that curiosity killed the cat and it seems they are afraid to face me as well. You I will forgive, not them. But not sight unseen. You have a beautiful mind amongst other things. All I know is that some things are real some things are not, probably due to the superficial nature of this whole social networking trend that they have the lemmings all using in order to keep what is real and true from coming out into the forefront. You truly are my first, too bad things are how they are and that so many people are against this, too bad for them anyways, I thought you were different, I guess time will tell. I won't leave you high and dry like they did, I used to be very much like you a long time ago, just be good and do good. I never expected any of this, maybe you did, not sure.

I understand you can lead a man on by paying compliments, flirting, or giving a sign, however, if you want to throw away your life with me then you will have to ask me out."
winter,Toronto,w4m,You gave me the gift of trust baby - w4m,"It was so special. Something I longed for finally happened. You stopped being so shy and let go. I love you more than anything in the universe. I'm so grateful for you and the three years we had together so far. We went through a lot but it made us stronger. I'm so excited to know what the future brings, my bestie, my lover, my sweet mensch. When you hug me tight I forget all the sadness in the world and feel pure joy. I can't even say how much you mean to me. I could look into your eyes forever. You are so loved and cherished and will be forever.KL "

winter,Toronto,w4m,For the man at Fu Yao Supermarket tonight - w4m,"To the man who got physically accosted by 4 employees of Fu Yao Supermarket this evening:I saw the whole thing happen and am willing to get a police statement if needed.The way you were treated was absolutely horrendous and totally uncalled for. The fact that 3 male employees and 1 female employee decided to man-handle you and try to hold you down on the mere ""suspicion"" that you stole something was excessive. And the fact that one of the men could not find evidence that you stole something and proceeded to destroy your bag of raw chicken was incredibly unnecessary. I haven't been able to stop thinking about this all night. I'm so sorry that this happened to you. I will no longer shop at this grocery store.I truly hope you file charges; and again, if you need a witness statement, please contact me."

winter,Toronto,m4w,Thank u??? - m4w,"I am not G. Im not the person U thought i may be. I did not see u last December.I think we both have the wrong person."
winter,Toronto,m4w,I thought I saw you walking by - m4w,"It's been a few years since I cut you out of my life. I knew if there was even a tiny piece of you left, my heart would never stop breaking. Sometimes I wondered what you've been doing since then, but I was afraid the sight of your face would hurt too much, even after all this time. I know you're doing well, though. I could see you become a stronger and stronger person during our years together, and I don't doubt that strength carried you to better places in life.At no point have I wished we were back together. I've never loved anyone as much as you, but by the end of our relationship, I knew our mismatches as people were just too big and neither of us were willing nor able to change ourselves to make it work. That's why I don't harbor any misgivings about how we ended things.After we parted ways, I decided to dedicate myself to my career and advance it to a stable, comfortable point before trying to find someone new. I like this line of work and I have a small handful friends and hobbies to occupy my down time. But I've never really felt happy. It might be because I feel romantically unfulfilled, or just plain lonely, but I think it's because all of the effort I'm spending just seems meaningless. For all of the pain we caused each other, you always gave me direction in life. That no matter what, I'd have someone there for me, to seek consolation from when times were bad and celebrate with when times were good. In retrospect, I guess that feeling gave me the motivation and confidence to work hard and get into this job in the first place.I thought I saw you walking by on the street today, and it made me realize that I miss my best friend, the only person I've ever really opened up to. Seeing your face brought back all these memories and dredged up all these feelings. Seeing you again hurt just as much as I thought it would, but I'm genuinely happy that you look well."

winter,Toronto,w4m,Everything To Do With Sex Show - w4m,"I was working the convention and met you on Saturday October 24th, as I was waiting for my friends working at the Condom Shack booth. You were with 3 other people - such a babe, and had possibly the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen. You asked me about my accessory because it's pretty unique. We chatted a bit which quickly led to some friendly petting, and then you were gone. I came up to you shortly afterwards for a brief moment - given the nature of the show, and how I was dressed, it seemed a little tacky and almost a little insincere to be asking for your number under these circumstances, but now I regret not having done so!You had a black toque on, which is extremely vague, but I was wearing something literally no one else at the show was wearing...what was it?"

winter,Toronto,w4m,Guy with amazing hair on the 504 streetcar - w4m,"It was somewhere between 1 and 2 PM. We were on the 504 streetcar heading towards Broadview station. I noticed you while we were passing through Roncesvalles because you got up and stood near the front door, and then sat down in a single seat 2-3 spots in front of me.Bro. Your hair. It was a thing of beauty. You: Mid to late 20s? White, tall, long grey jacket, Sperry shoes (I think), well-trimmed beard, and beautiful light brown/dark blond hair down to your nape that you continuously ran your fingers through. I was having a crappy day and decided I'd make myself feel better by passing out compliments. Before boarding the 504, I'd already told a girl I liked her lipstick and another lady that her scarf was pretty. When I saw you, I felt compelled to tell you that your hair looked glorious, buuuut I felt shy and decided I'd pass you a note saying so if my stop happened to come first.Unfortunately, you got off the streetcar before I did, and I definitely wasn't courageous enough to shout after you to say your hair looked awesome. But I still want you to know that it did, so I'm posting here on the very remote chance you might see this.I was the girl in the yellow winter hat sitting in a single seat.

In this world that you think you see, do you really think we all have soul-mates?If your dream was that easy, then people would have evolved to an existence beyond what I am doing and what your are reading?

If you wanna grab a drink sometime let me know what color coat I was wearing?"
winter,Toronto,m4w,GSD was our baby - m4w,"Hey,I wish our love was stronger than the patronizing love of ur parents towards u. I wished our love was that of the unconditional love in WALK THE LINE. If u would have not been so wrapped up in ur emotions as ur mom is with hers towards u. U could have stepped up like a strong woman and helped me fight my demons and get back to loving and relying on one another. Like the many times u said u are closer to me than anyone else in ur life. I didn't give up on u when u were frequently physically abusive towards me. I didn't give up on u when u gave up on seeing someone to face ur problems. I didn't give up on u when u were so lazy with ur job u didn't get even a minimum raise above inflation for years. I DIDNT GIVE UP ON U. u basically treated me how ur mother continued to treat u......always making it about herself when u needed her more than she needed u. That is what happened to us. U were mad I told them everything so u decide to try to be evil and one up me? Don't u think u already got me by leaving me when I really needed ur love and ur help? U didn't need to do anything more to hurt me than u already did. I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Ur mom frequently gave up on u, then u did the same to me. Ur dad somehow made our relationship about himself and his needs and wants instead of what his daughters needs and wants are. (It's not ur fault that he has an attachment disorder cause his parents shipped him off to boarding school) That is horribly selfish. Therefore I must accept where all these unethical personality traits u have came from. As that artist says in the chorus of that song u like...""we could have had it all"". If I had gotten over what happened with ur help and went back to what I was making$$$. We could have purchased a house easily with in a few years if we stayed organized. With our dog and cat and ur part time step child. THEN WE COULD HAVE SHARED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING.....BRINGING OUR OWN CHILD INTO THIS WORLD. U made a mistake by giving up. U know I'm a fighter. I really needed your love, support and security to fix the problem sooner. I DONT DRINK ANYMORE. I did bite the bullet and went for treatment. I had a friend watch the dog. I DID IT. Now I have almost quit smoking. I'm using an e-cigarette to help. 3 chemicals compared to 4000 in cigarettes is pretty good I think. I smoked less cigarettes yesterday than I have in years. My lungs feel great. I also am almost the exact same weight that I was yrs ago. About 200lbs. Dr. J. R. said to me yesterday ""all that muscle u have certainly weighs a lot doesn't it? As he smiled at me with a very proud look on his face. B said to me the other day that all he wants for his birthday is a hug and kiss from me as I still haven't seen him. I think he is actually starting to dislike his mom cause of what she has done. My lawyer is in the process of fixing the problem now. U have made yourself almost destined to not have offspring. I could have handled ur tricta and would have kept pushing u to try harder to see someone so u didn't ruin almost every wk end. As well as push u to be successful at work. The fact that u have not dealt with ur problems means they will arise again. Wait until u get past the initial easy part of falling in love again. Then u live with them and ur demons will eventually come to the surface once again. It's true for anyone and everyone. I have been seeing someone for PT every week for many months now. It's been hard but I'm almost completely better. That's why I have been able to stop drinking and now I'm kicking smoking in the butt. The fact that ur problems will arise again means u probably will not get a chance to be stable enough emotionally to have a kid. As if u thought ur life has been hard b4? U don't know shit. Having a baby is very draining scary and complicated. If U don't face ur problems head on u will never be ready to have a child. Which is sad cause it is also the most beautiful thing in the world. Any smart guy will not want to have offspring with u when he lives with u and starts to see how frequently unstable u r. How would u do the necessary picking of the ears, nose. Eyes and mouth which are necessary when u have a baby, when u can't properly handle ur own? (As they can not clean orfus's on their own). I did not want this to come across mean. I honestly feel bad for u and loved u openly and honestly and accepted all your faults. I NEVER gave up on u when maybe I should have. U did it in spades. I still love u and I always will. I TRULY UNDERSTAND U MORE THAN UR WHOLE FAMILY. They mostly know the child that was u. I know the adult that is u. If they saw how many times u attacked me they certainly would have a different view of the cute little girl. I'm sure u know that. I'm also sure that none of u want to accept what u got away with doing to me many, many times. I understand why u did all of that as I grew up with my own step dad and mom attacking me frequently. I am so, so sorry I stopped taking care of myself and how it must have had a very detrimental effect on ur life. I am truly sorry. I was just so very hurt that I obviously could not handle it. Amazingly I still miss u. I have dated a lot but haven't found someone that feels like we did when we hugged. It's just not the same.Take care.Luv always .. BearPs. U can run from all the feelings u had for me if u like. I know that IF u have a good heart u will remember the incredibly beautiful feeling when we held each other. With my arms wrapped around u and keeping u safe. I think I loved u b4 I even met u. Our term oil interpersonally broke us up. It certainly wasn't cause we didn't love each other. U will find that the feelings of love when we hugged for years that kept us together threw all the shit we went through is and will be very hard to find for both of us. I'll love u while I'm awake and still when I'm dreaming always and forever. (I still dream about u sometimes, it ain't all about hugging either...lolol)"

I found you very attractive and wanted to ask you what you were working on/studying but I had sat down a tad too far from you (12 or so feet). I hadn't noticed you until I was already starting to sit down.I'm not sure about your height but I guess 5'4"" to 5'5"" ish. You are quite slim and I think you were wearing a green jacket though I was really just looking at your face so am not 100% sure about that. I was wearing a green jacket and blue jeans and had a black leather bag over my shoulder. I'm 6'3"" and with short dark blond/light brown hair. I tried to make eye contact with you as I was leaving the train.

He has done everything for me, taken shots for me, given me more than he could offer. He does not care about himself. He only cares for the broken people in his life and I do not know if I could ever pay him back for the things he has done so selflessly. This - I hope - will make him stay. Because right now he is a very real flight risk. He loves you, he thinks you have simply forgotten about him. He gave me back my cell phone today because he is very set on leaving here. He never got one himself after he left her because he didn't think he would be around for too long anyways. I told him to keep it - just in case you would call to change his life. He has no way of contacting you anymore because the type of person he is, he gets rid of vices. I don't know what happened between the two of you but I have never seen him so happy. We do not know each other. In all honestly, I couldn't care less about you. But I feel like right now you are the only person that could change his mind.

Either a person is asking me for support or I am purchasing/requesting support from another individual.This is where our meeting comes into play. I came into your environment and I was mesmerized. You weren't like all the other girls of your type and I never figured out what you spend your time doing, but your demeanor and smile were to die for. You would be the greatest mother because of your sweet voice.However, I don't know if you were being nice because that was your job or because you were into me.

winter,Toronto,w4m,P.K - w4m,"Our love seemed to be a complicated one but in hindsight, it was not so bad. At times I thought we were so different, but we were really so similar. It took a second break up for you to finally tell me that you loved me, but that was too late for me. After loving and caring for you for years with no ""I love yous"" returned by you.... I did not want to let my love grow anymore for you because I resented knowing that you could live without me and be fine but that I needed you to be fine. I tried to make a home for us but you were selfish. Everything was about you and how you did not like how I made you want to have roots and settle down. All you ever tried to do was push me away and that made my heartache because I loved you so much. I should not have cut you off the way I did without explaining but it was the only way I could begin to move on. I could not keep talking to you because we would still be together if I did. I know you tried contacting me and more recently tried following me on Instagram. I do not know how you found me and I blocked you because it weirded me out at first. It reminded me of all those feelings I had when I left you. The ones that made me question my decision and made my heart throb. It made me want to call you but I did not. I believe in karma. I know you will never see this but I just needed to get it off my chest. Maybe in the tiniest of chances if you saw this message and responded there would be some divine intervention at play and we would talk. We both had a crazy love for one another. It was the most passionate and intense love I know that I will ever know. I look back on our time together and even though we sometimes fought and argued, you are in many of my fondest memories. I will always love you and I hope you have found your career and identity (not one in the same) and that you have learned that it's ok to feel vulnerable when you love someone. AP.S- I stopped by your work for my work a few years ago. I snuck into a hangar hoping to see you with no luck. Maybe this is how this is supposed to play out."
winter,Toronto,w4w,"""Hello, good morning, how you do?"" - w4w","I wonder, are you ever here-- in this space?It's been a few years now. We exchange written words occasionally. When the weight of our silence is lifted, I count your presence as one of many blessings in my life.Even through our casual connection, I feel your respect and desire for my well-being entrenched into your language. I accepted a long time ago, that I would have to pick through our exchanges to extract certain levels of meaning and intent. You were never bold with self-expression in the beginning. Regression to previous modes was unavoidable. But we've come a long way, considering. I'm thankful that we speak at all. But I had to come here to tell you that I miss you. .. That speaking to you, at times, creates a feeling of air... an expanse between myself and something just out of reach. I realize you've positioned yourself with purpose. And I will never hold it against you.Still. I wonder. Do you ever look for me here? In between the pleasantries that small-talk affords us, and the bigger moments that entail attention, do you find yourself searching for deeper significance in my words, or the absence of them?You were my best friend, underneath and at the foundation of everything you were/are to me.I'm here to remind you that you are ever important to me. If you're around, respond with the name of one of the streets we lived on together. If you say nothing more, that will be enough."

I just cannot seem to ask a woman out.Being a total failure, makes it hard to ask someone else to throw away their life by joining you.Feminism is getting popular, maybe you will be so daring to ask me. I will likely say no anyways but I will add because you can do better, at least this way you are not left wondering."

winter,Toronto,m4w,Polka dots at AAA - m4w,"Across the bar. Those feelings of: I hope she comes around to this side so that we can talk. And then she doesn't - and it's okay, just another smile and eye contact between strangers. No big deal. But that feeling; that worry: what if that polka dot girl could have those substantive conversations I've been lacking in my dating relationships? What if she was as ambitious as she was beautiful? What if she was in tune to what's going on in the world and we could share our opinions about it? What if we could challenge each other to be the best we can be?Of course, it's silly, right? Just a fleeting glance across a bar. What are the odds she could be all that? After all, if it were to be so, we would have actually spoken, not just locked eyes across the bar... Right?"

I never wanted to see the demons in you but you left me with no choice. I tried to help you see that I was never interested in anyone else, but it didn't matter. It was all a lie and you probably don't even remember me. You mattered and it's the hardest thing for me to realize I never did. I loved you and none of it mattered. I forgave you, none of it mattered. You dont even want to see me happy. I got punished for loving you.A."

I decided to get my coffee and was aiming my regular Starbucks off Evans. I decided to go into this one where I saw you. Parking was full but was convinced to get in. I found the last spot near the back. You were the first person I saw while walking in. Time actually stopped for a second longer. You kept looking at me while we were waiting. I looked at you back but you looked away or hid behind someone. I picked up my coffee and walked by you and we looked at each other one more time and smiled. I left the store and wanted to go back in to say hi. I did not. I felt that I'm not ready to date again from my last relationship. You were beautiful and your smile was angelic.

I noticed you in the registration area just as I was about to go to the coat check. I couldn't help but stare as you were wearing a pair of dark short shorts and a dark-coloured T-shirt, and looked quite fit. You're Caucasian and average height (and I find guys with great legs in short shorts SO HOT!!) You then passed me on the stairwell about 3/4 of the way up the Tower, and I followed right behind you for several flights. Your legs and ass looked so beautiful up close ;) When I got to the top you were there, waiting for the rest of your team. I got my golden opportunity to speak with you for a few minutes, and I asked you about your T-shirt and what was written on the back. I then gave you a pat on the back and wished you an enjoyable day, and then as I was heading towards the elevator, we locked eyes again. I smiled and winked at you. But that's all I could do. I would've loved to have told you that I thought you were really hot, but there were other people around and my voice carries. If you're interested in talking or meeting up for fun, let me know exactly what was written on your shirt and where you friends/team was from (company/institution/school). Cheers!"

winter,Toronto,m4w,Alpha Foxtrot Zulu - m4w,"This, for me, is not a contest pitting opposites against one another. If I could spend every moment of the day gazing at your pretty face I would, unfortunately I would be much worse off if that were the case, given the complications of our present situation. As we both know, some things do change and this could get quite a bit better. I am just not quite sure how to dance with you right now because it takes two to Tango. Any suggestions on how WE can move forward because I am not quite sure."

winter,Toronto,m4w,"to pseudonymously MS, from a grasshopper - m4w","I have no right to say this, but I strongly feel that I should, before it's too late, and too late just becomes more and more likely as time passes, so:I do not think you should marry him. I don't think he makes you happy enough. The way you've talked to me about him. ""It's what people our age do"" irks me.I can't help but think that you either want me to tell you to break up with him, or you tease me when you're frustrated because I'm so bloody easy for you. I know I'm not actually an alternate answer, but I feel like you've been caught on this path and you don't know how to get off. So, um. Take a step. I want you to be happy; I'm sure all your friends want you to be happy. I don't think I'm the only one who'd be willing to help you take steps to break it off for your greater happiness. I dunno. Maybe I'm presumptuous, and you're happier than you betray to me. Maybe I'm just an ego boost in those moments of irritation. That's not what I believe, but I've never actually seen you with him. You have seemed to keep him and I in different spheres, though whether that's for your benefit or assumed for mine is ambiguous. I hate how all the words above sound. I don't know how to phrase this better.Don't marry him. He doesn't make you happy enough.Maybe someday I'll be able to say this to you."

I then commented on your watch and outta the blue we have this conversation about marriage, kids, growing up and diseases. You seem like a very nice woman to talk to as you were opening up to a total stranger and I felt like I was talking to someone that I actually knew personally.I hope you see this as it's a long shot and I would love to chat with you some more and hoping we can spend time with one another.If this is you and only you please let me know the exact place we were chatting, what kind of watch you were wearing, what disease do you have and plenty of other stuff to prove it's you.

I think this was obvious, seeing as I kept trying to make eye contact with you (when we weren't making eye contact). Oh man, I'm starting to sound like every poor soul on this thing now! I wanted to tell you how much you resembled my ultimate blonde childhood crush from Saved by the Bell (especially after a healthy amount of Steamwhistles were consumed) but ALAS that never happened. So instead, I'm throwing it out into the vague abyss of the internet. I'll try my fancy carrier pigeon as well, just in case."
winter,Toronto,m4m,less terrible - together - m4m,"We are both looking for something, maybe someone. Maybe ourselves. We're slightly broken. But not irreparably. You once told me you liked spending time with me learning ways to be less terrible. Maybe I forgot to tell you: that is what I spend most of my time doing. Did we have a date? Did we meet as friends? I had fun. And why can't we have sex with our friends? (haha) Is it a boundary thing, and we convinced ourselves that we are more enlightened than those who self-impose such boundaries? Is ours a self-serving approach to boosting our brain chemistry? Is it a pattern-driven way to be self destructive and prevent ourselves from having more lasting relationships that are actually emotional? What would we really want to replace friend-sex with? Maybe one day we will figure it out. And schedules suck.We are always working. Or I have homework. Or you have an audition. If you think we should put our bodies at the same location at the same time, for the sake of our minds or bodies or both, get in touch."
winter,Toronto,w4m,"""I don't wanna wait"" for this streetcar to be over - w4m","You were driving the 511 and had everyone laughing when you asked the entire streetcar if it was going to rain so you could decide how to spend your weekend. I fell in love instantly when you proudly declared your intentions for karaoke to sing the theme to Dawson's Creek. When you then proceeded to sing the chorus loudly over the speaker, I knew you were my soulmate. Sadly, we got short-turned. I told you to ""have fun"" as I left the streetcar and waited for the next car (which, by the way was not right behind you, but it's ok I was in too good of a mood to care)."

winter,Toronto,m4w,AC - i've had a crush on you for a while - m4w,"To the lovely lady with the initials ""AC"" I've wanted to tell you this for a while now. I can't hold it in any longer. A long time back we were part of a student program studying a particular language. I met you at that program. After having coffee at the cafe there you asked me back to your room, I declined for many reasons, I did not want you treat you like a onetime thing, I had a girl friend at that time and I was trying to be good. I was so stupid and naive at that time as well. I try and bang my head on any hard object I see around me, every time I think of this. We are friendly now and we both have significant others. You work downtown and I work uptown. I'd be embarrassed and glad if you read this now, not sure what you thought then or if you ever think of it now."
winter,Toronto,w4m,Smiling Bearded Man - w4m,"To the smiling bearded man on the bus: thanks for making my kid smile. Though confused about who you are, you reminded him of our friend who now lives far away. I found myself intrigued by the tattoo on your right 4th finger.

My affection for you is no secret, and I would love to pursue you further, but the current circumstances are unfavourable. The day I first met you I was speechless, you took my breath away, and the more I got to know you the more drawn to you I felt.

You had left a gym (I think you said) and actually spent a considerable amount of time to walk with me to Yonge St. Even going back into the building after going out onto the street. You were so kind and pleasant. I would like to thank you personally (with a drink maybe? Or just a thank you:) You actually walked me to the door of the building I was going to on Yonge. Wow!

winter,Toronto,w4m,"RE - Probabilistically, she doesn't exist - You took it down! - w4m","So you have a high opinion of yourself, self-confidence is useful, neat.What confuses me is how boring your post was. You talk a big game about boredom and the lack of thought in most people's heads and then you don't talk about anything interesting.RecentWorld - what do you think of Russia's involvement in Syria changing after the possible bomb on one of their planes? Extrapolation - What do you think of the proof of concept of a magnetic wormhole? MacroIssues - What do you think humanity would have to do in order to surpass the limitations it imposes on itself?You go on and on about being bored of humanity but that's all you do, and THAT is boring.Try harder bb, there are people that aren't boring but you have to be less of a peacock and more of a brain."

Even if I'm having a bad day, seeing / talking to you makes it a good one. I wish you didn't have a boyfriend. Or, well more accurately, I wish I was your boyfriend.

Which is boring. - m4w","Apparently three numbers are important to people- firstly in this plastic day and age it helps to have a six-pack (despite not working out, gyms being fucking retarded as they are) and a pretty good face. An accent doesn't hurt either, so I should be blessed- the problem is I am smarter than 95% of people, and more emotionally evolved as well. They're others' stupid tests, not mine.It's pretty funny to be accused of arrogance by the stupid and egotistical, but then that's the nature of people, with their subjective responses. They compare themselves to people like me, realise they fall short, and hate us for it. Which is just.. hilarious. Fuck those people. Should have tried harder ;)Sound familiar? Seeking a fellow deliberate sub-genius? Know you're hot but don't give a fuck because pleasing the retarded isn't worth it? Managed to buck the social trend and not drunkenly fuck dozens of burgerkine who don't know how since puberty? Refreshing absence of crippling self esteem issues you have nobody but yourself and the aforementioned whoring spree to blame for? Do drop me a line. I'll be most surprised!"
winter,Toronto,m4w,We exchanged looks on the 52 Lawrence bus - m4w,"I was sitting down and you were standing in front of me. Exchanged brief looks and I thought you looked attractive. I was wearing a black northface jacket and you ..black lether jacket...I think.Write back if that was you."

winter,Toronto,m4w,Halloween: Dr. Octopus seeks the Annie Hall of Line 2 - m4w,"When the man beside me asked if I was dressed as a scorpion you were there to politely correct him. I don't think either of us was surprised when he asked if you were a character from The Royal Tenenbaums, given that you were in the the most stunningly accurate Annie Hall costume I have ever seen and he had not heard of Woody Allen. You smiled from across the aisle as you explained how ""we don't really like Woody Allen right now"" and laughingly showed us the badminton racket and plastic lobster that elevated your incredible costume to near legend status. I was hoping we would get a chance to trade a few more movie jokes! Talking to a pretty girl on the subway is tough (especially when you have several mechanical arms protruding from your overcoat) so maybe we could go to a movie some time. It doesn't have to be The Sorrow And The Pity, but perhaps Marshall McLuhan will be in the lobby."

Ive never ever reacted so strongly to someone ive never met before.You asked me if it was raining outside and I said yes, and you proceeded to tell me you were supposed to have a bonfire/ party the next day and hoped it wouldn't be raining then as well.

winter,Toronto,w4m,Re- the foreshadowing language of doom (trouble) - w4m,"You know I hate to debate semantics, but feel the need to point out that you should really try to at least understand the meanings of words you use. The word sparse is only used to describe density, that being low density. Used in the context you did, it is basically nonsense. You should have said that you will make yourself scarce. Have you been smoking something? Or did you just flunk high school english?From the sounds of it, whoever this was addressed to, it's a good thing you aren't going to be around. You sound like someone who isn't capable of having a rational or mature discussion. You probably just flap your gums for the sake of it and pull stuff out of your gluteus maximus. See, didn't that sound a bit absurd, calling a rear end a gluteus maximus? A person can string together a bunch of big, esoteric words but if they don't have the intelligence to back them up, it all just comes across as rubbish.Obviously you are trying to intimidate someone....the question is why? And then you label THEM toxic? Wow!"

I know you've moved on. I contacted you by email so many times but only once you responded and said not to contact you and gave me the reason.

Next thing I know I see you swerving around the slower drivers, with me chasing right behind you because it seemed fun at the time. Was your car stock? Were you driving stick? I have all these questions for you that it's driving me nuts. I followed you, at your pace, trying not to over do it up until Neilson and Finch. I saw you braking and then you just floored it. I was braking because I thought maybe I could get a better look at you. I hope you see this, I wanna do that again...except this time I'd be taking you more seriously and trying to pass you rather than follow. :]"
winter,Toronto,m4m,help me define something - please! - m4m,"So I'm not really looking for a missed connection but I think that I may be missing something. Facts about me:I'm gay.I'm Caucasian .I'm 40.I'm employed. I'm educated. I like to travel.I'm 5ft 9in. I weigh 180lbs. I have a 34in waist (33 on a good week).So, all facts. Perception: I think I'm chubby. I like food. Healthy and not so much. And no disrespect to those who are about to read what I write next but - is a person (male or female) classified as chubby if they weigh in at 260lbs? And is no more than 5ft 10 or 11 inches? Did I miss something? Should I be calling myself something else? I'm not wanting to make people feel bad - I mean I know I'm over weight! Saying 260lbs is considered chubby isn't like saying well 40 is the new 30. Because it's not. I'm sorry - it's not.That's my perception.
